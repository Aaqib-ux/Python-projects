"Started a business to escape corporate BS, ended up creating different BS",Organic_Yard9225,317,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0gkwp/started_a_business_to_escape_corporate_bs_ended/,"left my corporate marketing job 18 months ago to start my own digital marketing consultancy. was so done with pointless meetings, office politics, having to ask permission to do basic shit. thought being my own boss would solve everything. and in some ways it has. no more commuting, no more pretending to look busy, no more corporate buzzword bingo.

but i've somehow created a whole new set of problems. now instead of one demanding boss i have 6 demanding clients. instead of office politics i have to deal with late payments and scope creep. instead of pointless meetings i have endless sales calls with people who want champagne results on a beer budget. plus the feast-or-famine cycle is fucking brutal. one month you're turning away work, the next month you're panicking about making rent.

i don't want to go back to corporate. but entrepreneurship isn't the magical freedom solution everyone makes it out to be. it's just a different kind of stress. anyone else feel like they traded one set of problems for another? how do you make the business side sustainable without losing the reasons you started it in the first place?"

And last month this tool I made hit $1.8k/month, before I was always tried to be unique and find untouched markets but I learned that I can just take a fraction of someone else's proved demand.

So don't let that 200k competitor disappoint you, it should actually do the opposite

"Wife's not supportive of my side business, even though I'm doing everything I can",After_Willingness450,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0ksah/wifes_not_supportive_of_my_side_business_even/,"My wife and I haven’t been on the same page for a while now and it has taken a real toll on our relationship over the last year or so.

We have two kids, a 7-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son, and yeah, it is a lot. I am not going to pretend otherwise.

For years I have struggled with my job as an accountant. There has always been this deep feeling that I chose the wrong path, and on top of that, I am not even great at it. But I stuck with it for the sake of the family. I even pushed myself to do the ACCA qualification, hoping it would lead to a promotion and better income. It was supposed to take 2 years, but it took me 5. Undiagnosed ADHD and dyslexia definitely did not help, but I pushed through and got it done.

Fast forward to about two years ago, a close friend and I started a media studio to host podcasts and shows. We somehow pulled it off with a £30k grant, so there was no financial risk to the family. We now have a high-end studio, multiple shows running, and viral clips on Instagram, some with over 200k views. It is not just a passion project. We have had interest from companies who said if we can get those kinds of numbers consistently, there is business to be done.

Throughout all this, I have made sure to be as responsible and supportive at home as possible. I still work full time at my day job, even though I hate it. I do the school runs, cook, clean, and help with everything. Everything except breastfeeding, basically. When I work from home, I make sure the kids are sorted and dinner is ready so my wife can relax and have proper time with them.

If I were single, I would probably be living in the studio trying to make this work full time. But that is not reality.

So, I have carved out Sundays to work on the studio. Recording, editing, managing everything. It is a lot, but we are seeing steady progress. And even though I am gone the whole day, I try to get things done before I leave. I take the kids to soccer in the morning, hang out at home, and even get some chores done like ironing their uniforms. Then I leave around noon and make sure I am back before bath time. I help with the baths, we do some bedtime reading together, and after that I usually clean up the house so it is all set and ready for Monday.

My wife is not happy that I am out on Sundays though. She says it is too much to handle on her own. I offered her Saturdays completely off so she can recharge, but then she said we will not have a full day together as a family.

For context, my business partner also has kids, but he just commits fully regardless of what his wife thinks. I am not really built like that. I try to keep things balanced.

The hard part is that my wife has never once asked how the business is going. She is not supportive, does not show any interest, and when I asked her directly what she wants from me, she said she wants me to progress in my career. Meaning the one I have been miserable in for over a decade.

We are in a really bad place right now. We see life differently.

Growing up, I saw my dad work hard, come home just before bedtime, and we would hang out for an hour. That was enough. He is still my hero. I do not feel like I missed out. But maybe things are different now.

Anyway, just wondering if anyone here has been through something similar. Would really appreciate any thoughts or advice.

Edit: my wife also has a full time job. On the days she works home she will make dinner etc and visa versa. We both work from home 2/3 days so all pretty even "
scared to increase my rates for my design agency,vukajI,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0vw99/scared_to_increase_my_rates_for_my_design_agency/,"hey reddit community, i have a question. should i raise the prices of my services or not? i run a small branding agency and work on projects that go from 2k to 8k per month or one-time projects around 3 to 5k.

my client base is growing fast and it’s getting hard to keep up with all the projects, revisions, and chasing payments. i’m thinking about raising my rates by 20 to 30 percent.

i know some clients might drop off, but i’m scared i won’t be able to find new ones willing to pay the higher rate. it feels weird. i just hired another team member so i have a bit more room now.

for context, we do brand design, web design, and ongoing graphic support for different industries like tech, healthcare, consulting, cannabis, and real estate.

btw i have two more questions. how did you handle raising your rates and how did it go with your existing clients?

and second, has anyone here used reddit to find new clients? i’ve heard lately that it can be a good place, but from what i know most related industry subreddits have strict no-advertising rules."

Don't start a business if you love doing a trait,Pewis_Pamilton,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o08v6x/dont_start_a_business_if_you_love_doing_a_trait/,"Example: You really love webdesign. Or you really love woodworks. Or you really love gardening. 

Do not start a business because you think that's all you are going to do. 

When you start a business, you need to work your trait, but you need to spent A LOT of time getting new clients, networking, advertising, bookkeeping, finances, etc etc. 

Running a business is a completely separate thing to doing the thing you love. Unless you love running a business with all it's dimensions mentioned above. 

So if you want to primarily do one thing that you love, think twice about starting your own business as you might end up doing so many other things instead of the thing you loved so much. Add in all the stress and you might start to hate the thing you loved so much. 

This is not to discourage you, but by starting my own webdesign company a couple of years ago, taught me that I spent at least 50-60% on stuff that's not webdesign. It's getting new clients, constantly. Staying up to date with the newest trends, finances, spending hours and hours with clients just talking about their project. The same conversations over and over again. 

I happen to also like this, but I know plenty of friends that did not know the burden and the chores that come with your own business. "

We do about $2.5M a year in sales, and that’s being the smallest location in the company. I’m finishing my business degree next May and I also went to culinary school. I’ve always had a dream of owning a location one day, and recently I noticed the company started advertising franchising opportunities on their website.

I’ve talked to the owner a few times about my goals, how I’ve grown in the company, and how serious I am about my career. I get some creative freedom with cocktails and menu ideas, but I’ve definitely hit a plateau as GM. There’s not really anywhere higher to go unless something opens up at the corporate level, which doesn’t happen often.

They have about a dozen locations total mostly in Virginia, one in Maryland, one in Georgia, and just this one in Florida. I really think another Florida location could do well. Staffing wouldn’t be too hard since the company usually handles cooks, and I’d only need to hire front-of-house.

I guess I’m looking for advice from people who’ve gone from employee to franchise owner within the same company. How do you approach that conversation with ownership? How do you prove you’re ready without sounding naive? And what should I be thinking about before committing to something like this?

I built a prison and called it a business...and you probably are too.,ABrainArchitect,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzr52p/i_built_a_prison_and_called_it_a_businessand_you/,"I have a confession..

For years, I thought my problem was imposter syndrome. That voice saying ""you're a fraud, they're going to find you out."" So I did what you're supposed to do: I worked harder. I over-delivered. I said yes to every client. I hired people to fill the gaps I was scared to admit I had. I chased the next win, thinking it would finally make me feel legitimate.

And you know what happened? I became the ""successful"" CEO of a company I absolutely hated. I finally understood the real cost of imposter syndrome. It's not the anxiety. It's the life you build to try and quiet the anxiety. I was so busy trying to prove I was good enough that I built a business that had nothing to do with who I actually am.

The fix was realizing I had tied my worth to external outcomes (stuff I can't fully control) instead of my personal qualities, which I always can.

Outcomes might get people in the door, but they rarely make people stay. What makes them stay is the real stuff: your integrity, your insight, how you handle a crisis.

For me, when I made that shift, sales calls stopped being high-stakes performances. They became simple alignment checks: ""Are we a true fit for each other?"" The pressure to ""beat"" competitors vanished. No one can compete with who you *are* at your core. They can only compete on the commoditized outcomes.

Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is building a prison and mistaking it for a legacy.

  
\*\*EDIT\*\*: Let me clarify the one thing I didn't make clear.

That ""prison"" business? I left it behind. I didn't fix it. I walked the fuck away and built something new from scratch (after a break). The new thing is the exact opposite: it runs on a different scale I mentioned above. I only do work that aligns with who I am. And the interesting part is that it's more profitable. 

I guess my original point got missed: this wasn't so much about work-life balance.. more about building a business that was literally designed by my insecurities. The workaholism was a symptom of building an entire life around proving I wasn't a fraud.

Hope that clears things up a bit. "

The 3:1 LTV:CAC Rule is Wrong for Most Startups,FrequentBid2476,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0mkox/the_31_ltvcac_rule_is_wrong_for_most_startups/,"Every startup advisor tells you to keep your customer lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratio at 3:1. This advice is hurting more companies than it helps.

**The Problem with 3:1**

When I looked at 500+ successful SaaS companies, the fastest-growing ones weren't using 3:1 ratios. They were hitting much higher numbers:

* Ad tech companies: 7:1 ratios
* Design software: 6:1 ratios
* Cybersecurity: 5:1 ratios
* Entertainment platforms: 6:1 ratios

Then they would spend aggressively to grow, temporarily lowering their ratios to capture market share.

**Why 3:1 Can Kill Growth**

A perfect 3:1 ratio often means you're not investing enough in growth. While you protect your margins, competitors spend more aggressively at 2:1 ratios, steal your customers, and eventually dominate your market.

**What Successful Companies Actually Do**

Companies that reach $100M+ in revenue don't stick to 3:1. Instead, they:

* Invest aggressively when they find good growth channels, even if it drops their ratio to 2:1 for 6-12 months
* Use different ratios for different channels and customer types
* Treat their ratio as a range (2:1 to 5:1) based on their growth stage and market situation

**When 3:1 Makes Sense**

The 3:1 rule works for mature companies focused on profits, businesses with limited funding, or markets without much competition. But for venture-backed startups fighting for winner-take-all markets, it's too conservative.

**A Better Approach**

Instead of a fixed 3:1 ratio, use different targets based on your stage:

* Early stage (0-$10M): Accept 2:1-2.5:1 ratios to grow fast
* Growth stage ($10M-$50M): Aim for 3.5:1-4:1 while staying aggressive
* Mature stage ($50M+): Target 4:1-5:1, but still invest in new opportunities

**The Real Metric That Matters**

Focus on payback period, not just the ratio. A 2:1 ratio that pays back in 6 months beats a 4:1 ratio that takes 18 months to pay back.

**Bottom Line**

The 3:1 rule became popular because it's simple and makes investors comfortable. But the companies winning markets aren't following simple rules. They're making smart decisions based on their specific situation, competition, and growth stage.

Don't optimize for investor comfort. Optimize for winning your market."

I have a few questions, I’m working with an organisation that helps young people starting businesses and they’re also curious, so it’s nice to hear from people with experience.

1. How many users did your app have in the first 3 months? Mines been released for about a month and currently has about 150.

2. What would you say your user to subscriber conversion rate is for those of you with a subscription model?

3. For anyone with a subscription model, how many users keep their subscription active vs cancel after the first year (if you know)

4. Did you have to advertise your app, or did it do well without it?

5. How did you get people to rate the app? Push notifications? Or they just did naturally?

I know everybody is different and the answers don’t affect my app, but it’s just little questions we’re curious to know the answers too!

A Simple Habit That Can Save Startups Months of Wasted Effort,FlowerSoft297,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0j0s1/a_simple_habit_that_can_save_startups_months_of/,"Many startups focus on building features fast, hoping customers will just show up.

One highly effective habit is **daily micro-validation**: testing even the smallest ideas or features with real users before scaling or investing heavily.

This approach helps identify what actually matters to customers, reduces wasted development, and speeds up product-market fit.

Even validating **one tiny thing each day** can compound into huge time and cost savings over a few months.

Where do you go after you have accomplished THAT main goal?,ThomasC2C,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0cx32/where_do_you_go_after_you_have_accomplished_that/," ****serious post only****

Hi,

First time posting in here.

I was wandering if any of you have experienced some sort of low or “boredom” after you have accomplished your main goal.

To give you some context, just like everyone here, I had a professional goal that have been stirring and defining my life for about 20 years.

I work in the hospitality industry and I have worked all my life to be in the position that I am today. Every single decision I made and every discussion I have had in my life has been looking towards that direction.

In a way it’s great that it is working as for now as I was under a great amount of pressure of course.

But since this main goal has been reached I have been experiencing a change in mood and I do feel boredom. I am less “out for the kill”, less motivated. It sounds silly but it’s true.

I will be interested to know if some of you have gone through the same thing and if yes how did you cope?

 Thanks

So I am looking for a Co-Founder to bring some accountability for myself and to not waste this project. I need someone who can do the sales, marketing, etc., I will fully cover the technical part. The project is live, we can literally go ahead and sell, the product is created, it's a pretty simple one, and the value proposition is clear. It's a physical product and there are no upfront costs, not a high ticket product but the margins are nice (100% or more).

The target markets for this product are: hotels, restaurants, cafes, co-working spaces, conference venues, airbnbs. 

We can split the profit 5050, or whatever other way, we can discuss it. 

I don't want to advertise the project here so if this sounds interesting to you let's get in touch via DM. "

We’ve done 100+ demos for our B2B SaaS but no one converts .what am I missing?,WayTraditional2959,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0hn0b/weve_done_100_demos_for_our_b2b_saas_but_no_one/,"Hey folks,

I could really use some perspective from people who’ve been through the B2B SaaS grind.

We’ve built a B2B SaaS product (automation/testing domain) and have done 100+ demos so far. Most prospects genuinely like what they see they say things like “this looks great”, “that’s interesting”, etc. But the problem is:

👉 Hardly anyone signs up for a trial after the demo.

👉 Even the ones who do sign up rarely complete the trial or POC.

👉 It’s been 8 months, and we still haven’t closed a single paid client.

We’ve been consistently following up via email and LinkedIn, trying to keep conversations warm, but most of them just fizzle out after the demo.

So, I’m trying to figure out what’s going wrong here. Some possibilities I’m thinking about:

Maybe the pain point isn’t strong enough or urgent enough?

Could it be pricing, onboarding friction, or trust issues since we’re new?

Or maybe we’re not giving them a clear enough ROI or use case to act on?

If you’ve built or sold a B2B SaaS before what were the biggest blockers you faced between demo → trial → paying user?

And what worked for you to fix that gap?

Any real-world insights, examples, or frameworks you’ve used to improve trial conversions would mean a lot. 🙏

Thanks in advance!"
I have built an AI automation that won’t take anybody’s job,Turbulent-Height-823,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0hc9x/i_have_built_an_ai_automation_that_wont_take/,"I’m a consultant and coach (yes I dread the Big4 for reasons I’m not gonna get into in this post), and after months of blood and tears I’m finally gaining some traction.

And to gain traction means booking meetings, which I don’t always love (sometimes I can be an awkward dude), but it’s part of what I signed up for.

After each meeting, I like sending a follow-up sharing some more value and setting the client up for our next meeting.

Last week, it was my first time having two meetings in a row.

Usually I send an immediate follow-up, but this time I couldn’t.

Long story short, after the second meeting I forgot to send the first follow-up.

What did this imply? Did I lose the client? No, but it was an annoying hiccup in the customer journey which I didn’t anticipate.

What I did is I built an AI workflow to handle this.

It automatically pulls attendees from my calendar, drafts a personalized email, and gets it ready to send within minutes after my meetings.

No more forgetting a letter in the recipient’s address that could result in my email being sent into the void, no more copy-pasting, no more wrong attachment.

Will this replace anyone or completely disrupt the world?

Probably no, it will simply do what AI is supposed to do in the first place, freeing time for boring and repetitive stuff and allow humans to focus on what matters."

To give you a bit of a background, I started a small design agency a couple of years ago with my partner. It makes a decent yearly wage for a single person so to supplement the income I started working a job full time about 2 years ago. It’s been great because it took care of the financial stress, but at the same time, I have a lot less time to invest in the business. We get most clients through organic marketing, blogs mostly, I do the sales calls and on-boarding and my partner handles everything else. 

I know I can grow this business more and I have a ton of ideas. We are in a profitable niche and now have a good portfolio. I’d say 85% of the calls I get on, I book. 

But I’m feeling stuck. My partner, who is the one doing the actual work, is feeling overwhelmed and can’t really handle more projects. I suggested we hire someone but she finds it hard to delegate. 

I feel like I have everything I need to grow but am staying stagnant. I constantly come up with ways to improve the business but can’t find the time to implement, so the ideas stay shelved and I continue to move at the same snail pace. 

I’d love to find a mentor to guide me through this, but I don’t know how and where.

They have a MVP that they wrote with lovable, Which is fine.

They want me to be the CTO. However they are really into ""AI"". I don't know if they know what they really want I think they sold that to the investors. But basically they want a platform where they can gather information about the artist projects and then give a great summary of what it is and give a prediction on whether it will succeed or not.

I don't see this as the new ""AI"" as in LLMs and so on. I see it as a normal algorithm. I can't find the need for LLms here or even ML here right now. It's a simple platform.

They have done work, met potential investors and have a big list of artis, have advisors in law etc.

So that is the background.

Now they said that they need a CTO and they want to also get someone in AI to co-found with me. So it will be 4 of us. They want to split the ""technical"" part of it.

However, what I want to do will have a limited impact on that overall outcome and will help them with discovery and some positive brand association at best. Should I then pivot my dream outcome to be ""be popular amongst relevant audience on a positive note"" instead of ""your stock price will shoot up"" considering latter is a much bigger and complex problem to solve?

Context: I want to make video content for companies in my industry. Basically, do marketing for them, get them awareness, get them a reliable base of users/customers from my audience.

To cope with this, I have started using additives offered at petrol pumps, but this only increases the cost, making it even more difficult to manage. Given the high frequency of tank refills, my overall expenses have skyrocketed, which is a big problem since my business depends on cost-efficiency. If I raise my service charges to cover the increased fuel cost, the number of orders decreases, creating a tight situation for me.

I would like to ask the community if anyone has found effective bypasses or solutions or Mods that i can take up with Mechanic to avoid these issues with E20 fuel while keeping the vehicle mileage reasonable. Any advice or experience would be greatly appreciated as the rising fuel costs are putting a lot of financial stress on  businesses like mine.

Someone asked for my 4-step framework for finding a 'boring' SaaS idea that actually solves a problem. Here it is.,AlexeyAnshakov,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o09mqz/someone_asked_for_my_4step_framework_for_finding/,"The other day, I commented on a Reddit post about finding business ideas, and someone left the next follow-up question:

""Love the simplicity of this idea, and the value prop is so clear and obvious. How did you identify this opportunity? What was your process/approach?""

I decided to share it as a standalone post.

For context, my example was a ""boring SaaS"" I built for B2B auto parts distributors. They lose money because they're too slow to answer quote emails. My tool hooks into their Google Sheet inventory and replies in under 30 seconds.

Here's the 4-step process I used to find and validate this idea.

1. Listen

It started with a conversation. A friend who owns a small distribution business was complaining that he loses deals because he's physically on the floor packing boxes and misses quote request calls/emails. The pain wasn't ""I need an AI,"" it was ""I'm losing money while I'm busy.""

2. Validate

I spent a few days searching, learning, and speaking to other small distributors in different niches (HVAC, auto parts, industrial supplies). I didn't pitch anything, just asked: ""how do you handle incoming quote requests, and how fast do you typically respond?"" Almost everyone said it's a manual process and a major bottleneck.

3. Quantify the cost of ""doing nothing"".

I found the industry stats (78% of sales go to the first responder, average reply time is 47 hours. Perplexity helps a lot). Now the problem had a dollar value. It wasn't a ""nice-to-have"" anymore; it was a leaking bucket of money.

4. Build the 'dumbest' solution.

Sometime ago I built a ""Process-as-a-Service"" (PraaS) engine that allows me to link web forms with automation tools like n8n (I could write a whole separate post just on the tech stack).

But the first version was literally a workflow that did one thing: watch an inbox, find a VIN in the text, look it up in a single Google Sheet, and paste the price into a pre-written email. That's it. It solved 80% of the problem with 20% of the effort.

So that's the whole philosophy: find a painful, unglamorous problem, quantify the cost of not solving it, and then build the simplest possible thing to stop the bleeding."

"Business has generated lots of money, but is now stuck.",SaiyanGodOW,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzf9mh/business_has_generated_lots_of_money_but_is_now/,"I’m 26 years old and have been building my business with my team for about a year now. We operate in the e-casino niche and have recently surpassed $300k in total deposits, with around 1,000 registered users. Our best month so far brought in roughly $20k USD in profit.

We’re now at an inflection point, our growth has been almost entirely organic up to this stage, but scaling further will require strategic partnerships and additional resources. Marketing in our space is heavily driven by affiliates and content creators, yet most of the major influencers are being monopolized by a few competing platforms. Because of this, we’re often faced with inflated promotion costs, anywhere from $200 to over $1,000 for a brief 30-minute collaboration.

Most would probably think we could just work with the same influencers we have been and save up money, but even creators we've partnered with in the past have since been acquired and now demand outrageous prices for what may, or may not bring us valuable users. 

It’s clear there’s a bubble forming in the niche, and we’re carefully evaluating how to navigate it sustainably.

Should we bite the bullet and pay these inflated rates? Or find an alternative route to attain more funding.

Graveyard of bad ideas (long),EntropyLab,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzl7py/graveyard_of_bad_ideas_long/,"I’m a startup mentor/advisor, board member, investor, and have worked with accelerators as well as university startup programs. Everyone who works in this industry has a mental list of bad ideas that we have seen hundreds of times, that always fail (with *very rare* exceptions). 

If you’re an aspiring entrepreneur, especially if you don’t have the ability to bootstrap or self-fund your startup, you should be aware that it will be very hard to get investors, seasoned co-founders, and other industry pros to take you seriously with these concepts. 

This post is not meant to discourage you from building something you’re passionate about! Your friends and family have probably been excited to hear your idea. You probably think you have a special approach to this thing that nobody else has thought of. If you see it on this list, chances are that it has been tried thousands of times by other founders, and you just never hear about them because they never break into the public consciousness. (Leaving out dropshipping type side hustles and last-generation hype ideas like blockchain for xyz.) 

If you are able to bootstrap, you may still be able to build a healthy small business out of it! If you live in a country where the wave of certain products like this haven’t hit yet, you may be able to localize the idea. **But be honest with yourself about why a big competitor is not already doing it, or whether your concept has serious distribution, behavioral, economic, or structural friction built in.** 

* A better social media app. 
   * Yes, a lot of people are unhappy with the current social media giants. They are toxic, increasingly filled with AI slop, and use your data in shady ways. And yet, you will not get enough people to switch to your healthy, friendly, safe version unless you can get major celebrities/influencers to use it and spend crazy amounts of money on advertising. LinkedIn is annoying in different ways, but you’re not replacing that either.
* The all in one life organizer app. 
   * Users already have habits and nobody wants to switch to your unified dashboard. Whatever value you’re offering, it is probably smaller than the inconvenience of moving contacts, messages, calendar holds, etc. and retraining their brain to a new workflow.
* The app that lets you make group plans, split group bills, and fix group coordination annoyance. 
   * Or any related idea that text or Whatsapp messages and simple payment tools already do. Before you start, do a search for existing solutions. Have you ever used these? Probably not. 
* Dating app for \[niche group or location\].
   * It’s basically a right of passage to build one of these in your college dorm as you’re fuming over not getting dates. Build it for fun, build it to impress that one guy/girl, but don’t count on reinventing this industry. 
* AI that does \[things the big players are already building\]. 
   * If your AI product promises to be a life coach, mentor, co-founder, business ideator, marketing copywriter, summarizer for emails/meetings/PDFs, or some other successful use case of AI, the big tech companies are already getting these users. You need a serious technical edge or marketing wizardry to outsmart them, and a moat to keep users when OpenAI decides to copy you. 
* AI that does \[a highly regulated, complex thing in legal, accounting, healthcare, etc.\]. 
   * This is not a complete graveyard group of ideas, but one with a big asterisk. Unless you’re a professional with decades of experience doing this thing, you can’t customer discovery your way into a solution. If you’re on the tech side, bring on a co-founder with direct experience doing the thing or partner with an SMB that does this thing so you can get feedback and iterate on outputs. It will be a long, grueling slog to build the solution to a ‘good enough’ place that other companies will trust your product. Selling it will be equally hard, because every business is getting spammed with half assed solutions that promise the moon. 
* Ethical/sustainable/local ecommerce.
   * Totally rational idea, in theory a lot of people would prefer an alternative to Amazon, etc. But like any marketplace you need a critical mass of people on both sides (sellers/buyers), with the added limitation that now both sellers and buyers have to be interested in and prove that they’re ethical/sustainable/local/etc.
* Subscription box for \[something\]
   * Unless it’s wildly unique, CAC will kill you. 

* Slack / Notion / Asana but \[simpler, cooler, with AI\]
   * Switching costs are greater than whatever you’re selling. Your idea for how to improve these is likely a feature that the big guys can copy if it takes off. 
* Uber for \[a type of labor\]. Airbnb for \[random thing\]. Marketplace for renting \[something\]. 
   * Peer to peer only works when both peers exist in density. Are you tech washing a service that doesn’t actually scale? Is there enough repeat usage? The wave for copying these concepts has largely passed. 
* AI powered recruiting platform. AI powered job applicant support. 
   * Everyone that’s applied to a job in the last 2 years has experienced the hell that this process has become. But also, every HR department gets pitched tools like this anytime they post a job. AI doesn’t magically create more jobs or make candidate pools better, so you’ll likely just add to the noise. 
* Corporate wellness and team engagement platform.
   * Add to this ideas to manage company swag, gifts, events, diversity in recruitment, etc. Unfortunately companies do not want to invest a ton in these things, nor do they want to experiment with switching vendors. Even if you tell them their retention will go up X%. While employers have the upper hand in the job market, they will be unlikely to spend money on these. 

There are a ton more of these in education (AI tutors!), healthtech (app that reminds you to drink water!), productivity (app that beats procrastination!), basically all domains, but you get the idea. 

No judgment if your startup falls into one of these categories, I’ve been guilty of it. Critically think through where your concept will hit friction, and be honest with yourself whether you have a solid way of overcoming it. "
Why AI entrepreneurship is becoming the fastest-growing path for new founders,SilverCandyy,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o08o31/why_ai_entrepreneurship_is_becoming_the/,"If you’ve been thinking about starting something on your own, AI entrepreneurship might be one of the best entry points right now. Unlike traditional startups, AI-driven businesses often need less upfront investment, can scale faster, and solve real-world problems using automation and data.

Here’s what new entrepreneurs should focus on:
	1.	Start small, automate smart: You don’t need to build a huge AI system. Begin with micro-tools or automation agents that solve one specific problem.
	2.	Use open-source models & APIs: Platforms like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Stability AI make it easier than ever to build powerful products without massive infrastructure.
	3.	Validate before you build big: Launch MVPs, collect feedback fast, and iterate speed matters more than perfection.
	4.	Focus on distribution: Even great AI tools fail without users. Leverage Reddit, Product Hunt, and LinkedIn for visibility.
	5.	Build transparency & trust: Users are getting smarter about AI. Clearly show what’s automated and how data is handled.

We’re still early in the AI revolution the ones who experiment now will likely lead in the next few years.

I hear a lot of people say to ""just start"" and figure things out as you go. And I totally get that mindset, but I'm having some difficulties with the beginning phase. I come up with some ideas, and start planning things, but when I get hung up on is the paperwork side. I start second guessing on what I need to get started. After I get the idea, and think of how to get the product going, should I be filing paperwork with the government before selling anything? Should I get a DBA just to get started, or get an LLC even though I don't know how big this thing will be. Do I get an EIN or wait on that for now? Do I get a business checking account, or just start selling something and if it gets bigger, get one later? Is it okay to get a website and email address without a DBA or LLC, and is it alright to sell things for now without those, and get them after I start? 

I just get worried I may mess something up, and if something does relatively well, I want it to be sustainable and not be screwed up because I didn't do something correct in the beginning.
