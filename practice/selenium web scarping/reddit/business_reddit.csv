"Started a business to escape corporate BS, ended up creating different BS",Organic_Yard9225,320,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0gkwp/started_a_business_to_escape_corporate_bs_ended/,"left my corporate marketing job 18 months ago to start my own digital marketing consultancy. was so done with pointless meetings, office politics, having to ask permission to do basic shit. thought being my own boss would solve everything. and in some ways it has. no more commuting, no more pretending to look busy, no more corporate buzzword bingo.

but i've somehow created a whole new set of problems. now instead of one demanding boss i have 6 demanding clients. instead of office politics i have to deal with late payments and scope creep. instead of pointless meetings i have endless sales calls with people who want champagne results on a beer budget. plus the feast-or-famine cycle is fucking brutal. one month you're turning away work, the next month you're panicking about making rent.

i don't want to go back to corporate. but entrepreneurship isn't the magical freedom solution everyone makes it out to be. it's just a different kind of stress. anyone else feel like they traded one set of problems for another? how do you make the business side sustainable without losing the reasons you started it in the first place?"
Would you fire a 3-year manager for stealing $10 in cleaning products?,Try_Harder7,289,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0fn5z/would_you_fire_a_3year_manager_for_stealing_10_in/,"We dont sell cleaning products. We just have them to clean equipment. This person has been with our small company for 3 years and they have really helped me build the business. However they cant make it a full week without calling in or being 20 minutes or more late. The attendance has been an ongoing issue. 

Someone reported to me that the manager was playing a mobile game when I wasn't in the office. I checked the CCTV and sure enough, they did play a game for about 40 minutes on the clock. But when searching for the clip, I also saw them hide $10 worth of magic erasers in their purse!

I think its time I pull the trigger and fire them? Its so hard when we have built so much."
I cloned a Chrome extension with 200k users and hit $1.8k/month.,Commercial_Ear_6989,163,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0gnmm/i_cloned_a_chrome_extension_with_200k_users_and/,"[ChatGPT runied my text so I paste the raw one here]

I couldn't keep up with all the models that comes everyweek, so I went to see if there's any tool I can use to pay once and use all the models for different tasks I do, I found one with 200k users, I got disappointed at first but I realized I can build a simpler version so I did

And last month this tool I made hit $1.8k/month, before I was always tried to be unique and find untouched markets but I learned that I can just take a fraction of someone else's proved demand.

So don't let that 200k competitor disappoint you, it should actually do the opposite

"Wife's not supportive of my side business, even though I'm doing everything I can",After_Willingness450,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0ksah/wifes_not_supportive_of_my_side_business_even/,"My wife and I haven’t been on the same page for a while now and it has taken a real toll on our relationship over the last year or so.

We have two kids, a 7-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son, and yeah, it is a lot. I am not going to pretend otherwise.

For years I have struggled with my job as an accountant. There has always been this deep feeling that I chose the wrong path, and on top of that, I am not even great at it. But I stuck with it for the sake of the family. I even pushed myself to do the ACCA qualification, hoping it would lead to a promotion and better income. It was supposed to take 2 years, but it took me 5. Undiagnosed ADHD and dyslexia definitely did not help, but I pushed through and got it done.

Fast forward to about two years ago, a close friend and I started a media studio to host podcasts and shows. We somehow pulled it off with a £30k grant, so there was no financial risk to the family. We now have a high-end studio, multiple shows running, and viral clips on Instagram, some with over 200k views. It is not just a passion project. We have had interest from companies who said if we can get those kinds of numbers consistently, there is business to be done.

Throughout all this, I have made sure to be as responsible and supportive at home as possible. I still work full time at my day job, even though I hate it. I do the school runs, cook, clean, and help with everything. Everything except breastfeeding, basically. When I work from home, I make sure the kids are sorted and dinner is ready so my wife can relax and have proper time with them.

If I were single, I would probably be living in the studio trying to make this work full time. But that is not reality.

So, I have carved out Sundays to work on the studio. Recording, editing, managing everything. It is a lot, but we are seeing steady progress. And even though I am gone the whole day, I try to get things done before I leave. I take the kids to soccer in the morning, hang out at home, and even get some chores done like ironing their uniforms. Then I leave around noon and make sure I am back before bath time. I help with the baths, we do some bedtime reading together, and after that I usually clean up the house so it is all set and ready for Monday.

My wife is not happy that I am out on Sundays though. She says it is too much to handle on her own. I offered her Saturdays completely off so she can recharge, but then she said we will not have a full day together as a family.

For context, my business partner also has kids, but he just commits fully regardless of what his wife thinks. I am not really built like that. I try to keep things balanced.

The hard part is that my wife has never once asked how the business is going. She is not supportive, does not show any interest, and when I asked her directly what she wants from me, she said she wants me to progress in my career. Meaning the one I have been miserable in for over a decade.

We are in a really bad place right now. We see life differently.

Growing up, I saw my dad work hard, come home just before bedtime, and we would hang out for an hour. That was enough. He is still my hero. I do not feel like I missed out. But maybe things are different now.

Anyway, just wondering if anyone here has been through something similar. Would really appreciate any thoughts or advice.

Edit: my wife also has a full time job. On the days she works home she will make dinner etc and visa versa. We both work from home 2/3 days so all pretty even "

Hoping to get some real talk going here. I run a manufacturing platform called **THE/STUDIO**, and I'm hearing from our community that these new tariffs are no joke.

I'm trying to figure out the best advice to give our customers beyond just ""find a new supplier.""

Curious what other small biz owners are doing on the ground. Are you eating the cost for now? Focusing more on the ""Made in USA"" angle? Finding creative ways to add value so you can raise prices?

Just looking for some ideas because this is a real headache. What's been working (or not working) for you?

Honest question: Why do we ALL put off our business bookkeeping?

So, I'm genuinely curious:

How often do you put off your monthly bookkeeping, and what is the one thing besides more time that you think would actually force you to sit down and get it done?

Is it the fear of seeing the numbers? The chaos of the system? I'm trying to understand the problem better, because just doing it never seems to work!

Why every website needs a smoke detector (and most owners don’t know they’re missing one),Antique_Strain_2613,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o10qbg/why_every_website_needs_a_smoke_detector_and_most/,"This post is valuable if you are a website owner or know someone who has a website.

We all have smoke detectors at home. They are small, simple, and often forgotten. But when something goes wrong, they can save everything.

Now think about your website. It is the digital home for your business. Yet, most business websites don’t have anything that alerts them before problems happen.

There is no standard for website maintenance. Every developer does it differently. Some focus only on updates, others only on speed or security. But a healthy website needs all three.

Here are some facts every business owner should know:

* Around **1 in 4 websites** face downtime every year.
* **SSL certificates** expire every 90 days. Many never get renewed on time.
* Over **90% of hacked websites** are small business sites that missed updates.
* **SEO visibility** can drop by **30 to 50 percent** after performance or security issues.
* AI platforms like **ChatGPT and Gemini** now shape how people find businesses online. If your site is unhealthy, it may not show up there at all.  

So what exactly is website maintenance?

It means keeping your site healthy, secure, and performing well, the same way it was on launch day. Good maintenance keeps your site fast, safe, and discoverable. Most owners only check their site once, right after launch.  But you should check it **at least once a month**. Even if you cannot afford automated tools, you can do a lot manually.

Here is a simple checklist that can save you time and stress:

1. **Use Cloudflare** for free SSL and basic protection.
2. **Turn on the Cloudflare firewall** to block common attacks.
3. **Set up daily backups** through your host or plugin.
4. **Install a site monitor plugin** to check uptime and loading speed.

This setup helps you catch problems early. You will know when your SSL expires or if your site slows down. You will avoid losing traffic or customers because of unnoticed errors. And you can recover faster if something goes wrong.

Think of this as your website’s smoke detector. You may never need it, but the one time you do, it will save you money and peace of mind.

If you want to automate these checks, there are tools that can handle everything in the background. One of them is **SiteSignal**, which I built after years of fixing client sites too late. It runs scheduled checks, sends alerts, and offers free monthly audits you can try from the homepage.

These are the tools I’ve studied and tested while building my own system.I eventually created[ SiteSignal](https://sitesignal.app) because I wanted to combine uptime, SEO, and AI visibility into one autopilot dashboard. Even if you never use it, I hope this table helps you choose a reliable setup to keep your website healthy.

| Tool | Starting Cost | Uptime | SSL | Response Time | WP Updates | Security | SEO Visibility | AI Visibility | Reporting |
|------|----------------|--------|-----|----------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **UptimeRobot** | Free | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Basic alerts |

| **SiteSignal** | $39/Mo | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Weekly + monthly |

Even if you never use it, run some kind of health check this month. Your website is the heart of your business, and it deserves care. Corporate and enterprises has huge budgets and they have tools and separate performance and growth related teams. Small business we have only a few staff and a founder who is killing him/her self looking for next sale.

If you’d like, drop your website URL in the comments. I can run a free audit and share feedback right here so others can learn too. And if there are experts in maintenance reading this, please share your own methods.  I’ll happily add them, all these insights come from real experience, and the more we share, the better we all get at keeping our sites healthy.

Keep it healthy before it asks for help. *(Disclosure: I am the founder of SiteSignal, a website health monitoring tool.)*

scared to increase my rates for my design agency,vukajI,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0vw99/scared_to_increase_my_rates_for_my_design_agency/,"hey reddit community, i have a question. should i raise the prices of my services or not? i run a small branding agency and work on projects that go from 2k to 8k per month or one-time projects around 3 to 5k.

my client base is growing fast and it’s getting hard to keep up with all the projects, revisions, and chasing payments. i’m thinking about raising my rates by 20 to 30 percent.

i know some clients might drop off, but i’m scared i won’t be able to find new ones willing to pay the higher rate. it feels weird. i just hired another team member so i have a bit more room now.

for context, we do brand design, web design, and ongoing graphic support for different industries like tech, healthcare, consulting, cannabis, and real estate.

btw i have two more questions. how did you handle raising your rates and how did it go with your existing clients?

and second, has anyone here used reddit to find new clients? i’ve heard lately that it can be a good place, but from what i know most related industry subreddits have strict no-advertising rules."
How do you decide wage increases for long term employees?,aggierogue3,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0glq0/how_do_you_decide_wage_increases_for_long_term/,"I am a plant manager at a small manufacturing company, 1 of 2 plants. All of the employees at my plant are overdue for a performance/wage review. Not to make excuses, but we went through an acquisition last year and I'm 4 months into my role here, so the dust is finally settling allowing me to address this.

My family previously owned the company and we would often joke about how we had all the employees in ""golden handcuffs"", meaning we were paying them all well over market rate. Turnover here is close to zero, most of our employees have been here 10-25 years.

This puts me in an awkward position now. People are ready for another raise naturally. At the same time, most employees seem to be making over market rate and well over rates being paid at our main plant.

A few employees are easier to address. They have taken on significant responsibility and I can easily justify a sizeable increase in pay. Others have averaged 12% increase per year and I'm struggling to justify anything beyond a 3% bump.

I want to pay my employees well, for their sake and for morale. I also want to be profitable.

Any managers/owners here, how do you evaluate pay per employee? Do you try to figure out a baseline market rate to compare them to?"

Do bookkeepers really need their clients to be on QuickBooks?,intuitquickbookshelp,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0e3qq/do_bookkeepers_really_need_their_clients_to_be_on/,"I’ve noticed this pattern a lot lately — small business owners hire a bookkeeper, only to be told they must get a QuickBooks subscription (often $50–$100/month), even if they weren’t using it before.

It made me wonder — if bookkeepers already have their own accounting tools, why should the client pay separately for QuickBooks too? For small teams or solo business owners, that extra monthly cost can feel unnecessary.

So I’m curious how others here handle this:
	•	Do most bookkeepers prefer clients to use QuickBooks for syncing and file sharing convenience?
	•	Or do some manage accounting internally using their own systems or software?
	•	For smaller setups (1–3 employees), does QuickBooks still make sense, or are there lighter alternatives that get the job done?

I’d really love to hear from bookkeepers, accountants, and small business owners — how do you balance cost, convenience, and collaboration when it comes to accounting software?"

Opening a coffee shop- advice needed,Background-Crow-1101,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o101ly/opening_a_coffee_shop_advice_needed/,"So a small space just came available for rent in my town and I’m considering opening my own cafe (the shop is 1,100 sqft). The idea would be to have it a coffee shop by day (selling coffee, pastries, small food items, there is no kitchen) and then host community events by night (painting classes, book clubs, mommy & me classes, sourdough making classes etc). The space is currently a retail store, but also has a small coffee bar that sells pastries. They are SO loved by our community and we were all devastated to hear of its closing. 

Here’s where I come in: I’m in the hospitality industry and currently work events, weddings, etc. I’ve always dreamed of opening a cozy cafe where people in the community can gather, sip coffee, work and hangout with friends. I want to mix the two (coffee & community events) and bring the community together. 

My questions: I have no idea how profitable this can be, I’ve ran startup costs, operating costs, expenses etc but I have no clue for sure unless I just go for it, which is obviously scary. My monthly profits I calculated could be as low as $500 a month to as high as $5,000, depending on how well we do with coffee and events. 

Any advice is appreciated, I know my situation is unique but it’s important to note this is a great location, already has a good rep with the community, I can use the same roaster (who everyone loves) and it’s the only coffee shop in the town! 

Am I insane for thinking this could work and I could be making profit in the first 6 months? "

Is this really how some founders run a company? What's the intention of that?,WaitProfessional7610,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0zhd6/is_this_really_how_some_founders_run_a_company/,"Hi everyone,

Not sure if anyone here has ever dealt with an untrustworthy business partner, but I could really use some advice.

I run a very small startup with some overseas product connections. Last October, a young entrepreneur reached out to me and asked for help sourcing a set of customized equipment for his showroom in BC. He seemed very genuine even impressive. He showed me things that made him look powerful and well-connected, like how easily he could invite local politicians to attend an industry event he hosted.  
I have to admit, that made me believe he was trustworthy. Later, he offered a “partnership” with my small business, promising he would bring in more commercial contracts and let us use his showroom together. All I had to do was connect with the supplier and bring in the best products.

He suggested I join his ""group"" as an equal partner (half-half equity). It’s hard not to be tempted, right?

And then I managed to negotiate a globally lowest supplier price for this batch — it was a rare opportunity! I paid the supplier upfront and shipped everything to the freight company he designated. ( yes, this is the first mistake I made!)

Then, we signed a company shareholding agreement, not a purchase contract. (That’s my biggest mistake, I have to admit.) He transferred about half of the payment from his personal account to cover this order. But when it came to the actual “shareholding” part of the business, he never took any formal steps. **NO** equity changes, **NO** administrative setup, nothing concrete at all. It was just an **empty shell company under his name!** Even the showroom he had promised **“wasn’t available anymore”** just after the agreement was signed. 

When I asked him to pay the remaining balance of the order, he changed the story, saying this wasn’t a client-supplier deal anymore, but a “partnership investment.” I eventually realized it was a **scam disguised as a partnership**, when in fact it was just a simple supplier transaction I paid for upfront.

Well, if you say: Technically, you still own the goods by his logic. But the fact is the goods are stored in his third-country warehouse, and I have no control over them because they are effectively in his personal possession. So I asked him to ship the products to Canada I could help to sell them and settle everything properly. He then demanded high storage and shipping fees.   
He did has admit in chats that he would pay me the rest when he recived products, after many rounds of arguing. But since then, he keeps saying the different date of shipping and endless delays: “Next week.” “Soon.” “I’ll pay you at least half soon!” And yet, that virtual “next week” never comes.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

Some good news: He transferred about 15% in July, so now roughly 65% of the total has been paid. He even showed me his bank statements to prove he has the money to pay the rest “next week.”

But here comes the dramatic part: he keeps switching his story again and again. One moment he admits he owes me, the next he says it was a “joint venture.” Then, when things get heated, he promises to pay “soon” again. Yes, in his “next week.”

The only thing that hasn’t changed? The settlement date never comes. 

He never asked to have the products returned, nor did he make any move to ship them to Canada from the beginning. By this time, the products’ warranty had already expired.

I really can’t figure out his intentions. Is this really how some founders run a company? How can he still be active in social circles and even supported by city politicians? From what I can see, he controls a large network in his cultural market, yet no one seems to call him out for being dishonest.

You can take this as a story, but I’d really appreciate any legal advice or shared experience if you’ve ever dealt with something like this. I know I made mistakes and was too trusting, this has been a huge emotional and financial hit on my startup journey.

"Thought about so called ""AI Agencies""",hancy_07,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0xshz/thought_about_so_called_ai_agencies/,"I've seen lot of hate coming for ""AI Agencies"" servers like this where someone is trying to sell ""AI voice agents"" or ""AI Chatbots"" an I understand lot of them looks spammy and I also used to do that. 
But when I observed things little more where people are saying we don't need this or there is no demand for this or don't try to sell this services ,I've seen this opinions only when ""AI"" word enters.
Right now this word ""AI"" has now became like a marketing gimmick like if you try to sell ""AI powered Mirror"" that would probably get sold for lot of price. And this popular ""AI Gurus"" made some strategies available to public which lot of people are trying that's why all servers is flooded with ""I made AI Voice agent"" or ""i made AI blah blah....."". Just like that ""Automation Agencies"" also started using this gimmick word ""AI"" started saying we are ""AI Automation Agency"" just for marketing purposes and lot of people think this are just spam people but businesses actually need ""Automation"" in there businesses it could be AI-powered and sometimes we don't even need AI.
I've personally worked with businesses that actually got the advantage of ""Automation"" and save time and money a lot, now call it ""AI Automation"" or whatever you want but I think this ""AI"" word has become a gimmick word where they sell ""AI hype"" for their advantage just like in businesses we don't try to sell products but emotions itself.
So if you are thinking that you don't need ""Automation"" in your business if you have more than 100 client, you are probably thinking wrong.
Why I said more than 100 clients? Because below 100 it's just too low number where you can do it all by yourself instead of wasting money in ""Automation Agency"" or ""AI Automation Agency"" if you want to call it that way.

How to know if it’s time to walk away or just realign your business.,ABrainArchitect,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0wsan/how_to_know_if_its_time_to_walk_away_or_just/,"Every founder hits a point where the business works but doesn’t feel right anymore. Profit’s fine.. Team’s fine. But something in you changed, and the business didn’t.

I’ve talked to a lot of people in that spot, and I went through it myself. I built my first company fast (scaled, hired, grew). On paper it looked perfect. But it was built from fear. Proving something. Needing control. And when that version of me disappeared, the business stopped fitting.

Since then I’ve noticed a pattern. Some founders can fix it. Others can’t.

The difference comes down to how far you’ve drifted from the person who built it, and how deep that misalignment runs through the system.

When you burn it down or sell, the price is obvious: you lose momentum, maybe income, maybe your identity (painful). But you gain speed, clarity, and clean ground to build something that actually fits after. 

When you try to rebuild, the cost is slower, less dramatic, but more painful. You’ll spend months replacing people, processes, and parts of yourself you’ve outgrown.

Neither is wrong. They just cost different currencies.

In case you’re having that feeling, here are a few questions you can ask yourself to figure out which path makes sense:

1. Do I still believe in the problem I’m solving, or am I just keeping it alive because it works?

2. Would I build this same thing again today, knowing what I know now?

3. If I could start from zero, what part of this business would I instantly rebuild, and what part would I never touch again?

4. Does the work give me energy, or do I spend most of my time managing dread?


Your answers usually tell you the truth.
If the misalignment runs through every layer (product, team, values), it’s probably time to consider selling or moving on. If it’s mostly surface-level (strategy, structure, offers), you can rebuild.

Both paths require courage. One destroys faster. The other heals slower. But doing nothing just prolongs the pain.

Small healthcare practice owners — what do you use for phone answering or call handling?,AleaAperitif,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0wiop/small_healthcare_practice_owners_what_do_you_use/,"Hi everyone,

  
I own a small private healthcare practice and I’m trying to figure out the most cost-effective way to handle phone calls as a *part-time* practice owner.

I average about 45–65 inbound calls per month (roughly 3 a day). Right now it’s just me — I don’t have a full-time front desk, and I only work in the office a few days a week for about 3 - 4 hours at a time. 

I’m torn between:

* Paying for a live answering service (like Ruby, Moneypenny, or Specialty Answering Service)
* Using a voicemail-only system with quick text/email notifications
* Or finding some kind of hybrid / pay-as-you-go solution that doesn’t charge a big monthly fee

If you also run a small or part-time healthcare practice (medical, dental, therapy, etc.), what do you use?

* Which service or setup has worked best for you?
* Any that were a waste of money?
* Do patients mind if calls go to voicemail as long as you return them quickly?
* Have you found an affordable way to keep calls answered professionally?

Is this low-key price fixing??,thathotleatherchick,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0mxo5/is_this_lowkey_price_fixing/,"Alright buckle up--this is a tricky one. I have to keep some details vague to maintain privacy, but just know that I am in independent artisan that makes a handmade leather component. None of the process can be automated, nor do I get any discounts on materials required to make it that I can profit from--therefore my pricing to anyone wanting to resell this is the same as what I would charge a direct customer. Doesn't matter if I make one or 20...time and cost to me is largely the same.

Okay. I was signed as a contracted artist to a VERY large awesome company to create this leather component for any authorized dealer who wishes to place orders with them that include this leather on their larger very high price point item. I imagine obviously they will be marking up my leather but likely it will be baked into the overall price of the item dealers are buying and won't show itemized cost (and that item has MAP but even at that price allows dealers to make good profit). 

A local business who is a dealer of the large awesome company's high price point item has asked me to make this leather component for him personally that he can add to things he already acquired from them that don't already feature it. An aftermarket add-on if you will. Even though he still plans on purchasing these items through the large awesome company with my leather ""officially"" on them as well (more intrinsically collectible and certified this way). For whatever reason, he has chosen to install this component on the item but NOT add a perceivable markup to it. So in a sense, his version that features the leather might be priced the same as his competitor in another part of town that doesn't have the leather on it. That's his prerogative to not go over MAP. He's allowing the cost of the leather eat at his available profit margin in exchange for moving the item faster. 

Again, both him AND the larger company BOTH pay me full retail price for the leather component. But the other day, the local business owner contacted me and, in short, asked me to raise my prices for private clients (even double them) if they reach out to me directly for one of these leather components (even though I'd be charging them the same full retail as well). 

Is this not a form of price fixing or some other unethical request? Hey, I get not wanting the competition and I certainly don't want to water down the value of what I do. However, isn't it his job (and large awesome company's) to justify their pricing structures through branding, service, and presentation...and not to manipulate my base prices just to make theirs seem more justified? To be clear the big awesome company didn't ask this of me, just him. I'd much rather work out an exclusivity deal that benefits me or some way of offering them a justifiable discount instead so I can sell full price still privately--especially since this isn't a proprietary item.

Don't start a business if you love doing a trait,Pewis_Pamilton,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o08v6x/dont_start_a_business_if_you_love_doing_a_trait/,"Example: You really love webdesign. Or you really love woodworks. Or you really love gardening. 

Do not start a business because you think that's all you are going to do. 

When you start a business, you need to work your trait, but you need to spent A LOT of time getting new clients, networking, advertising, bookkeeping, finances, etc etc. 

Running a business is a completely separate thing to doing the thing you love. Unless you love running a business with all it's dimensions mentioned above. 

So if you want to primarily do one thing that you love, think twice about starting your own business as you might end up doing so many other things instead of the thing you loved so much. Add in all the stress and you might start to hate the thing you loved so much. 

This is not to discourage you, but by starting my own webdesign company a couple of years ago, taught me that I spent at least 50-60% on stuff that's not webdesign. It's getting new clients, constantly. Staying up to date with the newest trends, finances, spending hours and hours with clients just talking about their project.

* Am I supposed to fill out a W-9 even though I'm foreign?
* Or should I be using a W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E instead?
* Does it make a difference if my LLC is single-member or has multiple members?

Any insights or experiences would be super helpful. I just want to make sure I'm compliant and not giving out the wrong form."
LLC filing in which state?,signofno,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0ucdh/llc_filing_in_which_state/,"If I live in CA and have opened a brick and mortar business in Maryland with a local (to Maryland) partner, do I need to file the LLC in CA or register as a foreign LLC in CA or just file an LLC in Maryland? 

The business only serves customers in Maryland onsite and I do a minor amount of logistical work from home in CA but I don't otherwise conduct any of that company's business in CA, and by the nature of the business, we physically cannot serve customers offsite. 

We don't have ""inventory"" or sell products so I'm not running orders online or anything like that, most business is conducted through an onsite manager we have hired, and I regularly fly out to assist with larger customers in person but obviously that happens in Maryland, so again, other than some paperwork and the occasional zoom meeting I do from my office in CA, 99% of all work done by the business is conducted in Maryland. We have an EOR that handles payroll but I do make calls to check on things from time to time, discuss operational needs with my partner and the manager, and schedule site visits.

As for CA, I have a dedicated office in CA and do not work from home for any of the businesses I own. Both of the two companies I own in CA are registered as LLCs in CA - one conducts 80% of its business in CA but is not a brick and mortar operation, the other is a brick and mortar location similar to the Maryland operation and conducts 100% of its business in CA.

Hoping someone can tell me which way to go with the LLC filing."

How do you stay motivated in your day job when building something on the side?,Capable_Pudding3464,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0mgcv/how_do_you_stay_motivated_in_your_day_job_when/,"I'm an experienced software developer working corporate jobs for the past 12 years or so. Earlier this year, a friend had a business idea and needed a software dev to make it happen. He gave me a call and I accepted, thinking ""why the heck not"". I was not particularly happy with my current role and I knew I would probably have to find something else in a foreseeable future. This opportunity was a great answer.

So fast forward a few months and we're deeper than I initially thought we would get. We have a working prototype, we are scheduled to take care of the legal aspects of actually starting the business this month and we have several potential clients just from my partner's network waiting for us to be ready to sell. We don't want to get too much ahead of ourselves, but we sincerely think this business might just work.

Our end goal is to be profitable enough to be able to quit are day jobs. My question is : how does one manage to stay focused and efficient enough to not ruin their reputation while also trying really hard on that business on the side? Lately, I feel like I've been slipping up more than I should, missing non-crucial deadlines or just taking too much time for tasks that shouldn't take so long, because I'm too busy thinking about something else or just tired because I spend most of my free time developing a business. I'm not ""stealing time"", but let's just say that I'm not as productive as I should be for them.

My reputation at that job might not be very important once my business is up and running smoothly, but until then, I can't afford to be fired since I have a wife with a much lower income and 3 kids, a house, etc... And unfortunately, I don't have enough saved to just quit now.

I feel like like that's a struggle that many business owners had to deal with a some point. How did it go for you?"

Right now we have been doing pop up markets, night markets, etc and have been seeing a general increase in profits month by month for 6 months(we do about 3-4 pop ups a month). We have also seen an increase in repeat customers which surprised me. 

We both work full time so we aren’t relying on the money from the business. For the first two months we never broke even but it was alright since id consider it a passion project. Kind of proof of concept. 

However I completely understand that as of now the way we operate is vastly different from an actual store front. We have considered doing an online store but I don’t think it’s feasible to compete with Barnes and Noble, Amazon, etc. 

Plus, we would not want to open a brick and mortar store where we are currently located so we would lose the current repeat customers. 

So my question for you guys is should we commit once we have the capital? Or are bookstores pretty dead/unlikely to survive their first five years? Personally I’d love to have a third space for a community and am super passionate about books. "

I’ve been at my current restaurant for almost 5 years, started as a server, and worked my way up to General Manager. I’ve been running the store for two years now.

We do about $2.5M a year in sales, and that’s being the smallest location in the company. I’m finishing my business degree next May and I also went to culinary school. I’ve always had a dream of owning a location one day, and recently I noticed the company started advertising franchising opportunities on their website.

I’ve talked to the owner a few times about my goals, how I’ve grown in the company, and how serious I am about my career. I get some creative freedom with cocktails and menu ideas, but I’ve definitely hit a plateau as GM. There’s not really anywhere higher to go unless something opens up at the corporate level, which doesn’t happen often.

They have about a dozen locations total mostly in Virginia, one in Maryland, one in Georgia, and just this one in Florida. I really think another Florida location could do well. Staffing wouldn’t be too hard since the company usually handles cooks, and I’d only need to hire front-of-house.

I guess I’m looking for advice from people who’ve gone from employee to franchise owner within the same company. How do you approach that conversation with ownership? How do you prove you’re ready without sounding naive? And what should I be thinking about before committing to something like this?

I built a prison and called it a business...and you probably are too.,ABrainArchitect,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzr52p/i_built_a_prison_and_called_it_a_businessand_you/,"I have a confession..

For years, I thought my problem was imposter syndrome. That voice saying ""you're a fraud, they're going to find you out."" So I did what you're supposed to do: I worked harder. I over-delivered. I said yes to every client. I hired people to fill the gaps I was scared to admit I had. I chased the next win, thinking it would finally make me feel legitimate.

And you know what happened? I became the ""successful"" CEO of a company I absolutely hated. I finally understood the real cost of imposter syndrome. It's not the anxiety. It's the life you build to try and quiet the anxiety. I was so busy trying to prove I was good enough that I built a business that had nothing to do with who I actually am.

The fix was realizing I had tied my worth to external outcomes (stuff I can't fully control) instead of my personal qualities, which I always can.

Outcomes might get people in the door, but they rarely make people stay. What makes them stay is the real stuff: your integrity, your insight, how you handle a crisis.

For me, when I made that shift, sales calls stopped being high-stakes performances. They became simple alignment checks: ""Are we a true fit for each other?"" The pressure to ""beat"" competitors vanished. No one can compete with who you *are* at your core. They can only compete on the commoditized outcomes.

Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is building a prison and mistaking it for a legacy.

  
\*\*EDIT\*\*: Let me clarify the one thing I didn't make clear.

That ""prison"" business? I left it behind. I didn't fix it. I walked the fuck away and built something new from scratch (after a break). The new thing is the exact opposite: it runs on a different scale I mentioned above. I only do work that aligns with who I am. And the interesting part is that it's more profitable. 

I guess my original point got missed: this wasn't so much about work-life balance.. more about building a business that was literally designed by my insecurities. The workaholism was a symptom of building an entire life around proving I wasn't a fraud.

Hope that clears things up a bit. "

Has anyone here actually gone down this route? Did using a collection agency help you recover anything, or did it just create more hassle? And if you did, how did you handle future contracts to avoid this happening again?"

Later that day she told me she needed the order for Wednesday. I told her it was too soon but I will work hard with all my team. So she could have her cupcakes on Wednesday at the end of the day. Today is Tuesday, she sent me a message telling to deliver the cupcakes today in two hours. It is impossible for me to have all the cupcakes in two hours so I told her I have to cancel her order, and I will return her money completely and inmediatly (even though I already brought ingredients, and bake most of the cupcakes). She then told me she could receive the order on Thursday but it will have to be in the morning. I told her again that her order was already canceled, and that I am waiting for her information to give her money back.

1) I likely will not be selling yet until January of 2026 so I was thinking of going sole proprietor until then, and then forming an LLC to avoid paying the $800 tax both in Feb and again in April.  
2) Do I need to create a DBA now?  
3) Is a DBA required to then file for the name trademark with USPTO or is that done under my own name?  
4) In my research I saw that filing for a federal trademark protects the name nationwide, but having a DBA in the state of CA does not protect that name. Isn't that kind of counterproductive?

The 3:1 LTV:CAC Rule is Wrong for Most Startups,FrequentBid2476,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0mkox/the_31_ltvcac_rule_is_wrong_for_most_startups/,"Every startup advisor tells you to keep your customer lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratio at 3:1. This advice is hurting more companies than it helps.

**The Problem with 3:1**

When I looked at 500+ successful SaaS companies, the fastest-growing ones weren't using 3:1 ratios. They were hitting much higher numbers:

* Ad tech companies: 7:1 ratios
* Design software: 6:1 ratios
* Cybersecurity: 5:1 ratios
* Entertainment platforms: 6:1 ratios

Then they would spend aggressively to grow, temporarily lowering their ratios to capture market share.

**Why 3:1 Can Kill Growth**

A perfect 3:1 ratio often means you're not investing enough in growth. While you protect your margins, competitors spend more aggressively at 2:1 ratios, steal your customers, and eventually dominate your market.

**What Successful Companies Actually Do**

Companies that reach $100M+ in revenue don't stick to 3:1. Instead, they:

* Invest aggressively when they find good growth channels, even if it drops their ratio to 2:1 for 6-12 months
* Use different ratios for different channels and customer types
* Treat their ratio as a range (2:1 to 5:1) based on their growth stage and market situation

**When 3:1 Makes Sense**

The 3:1 rule works for mature companies focused on profits, businesses with limited funding, or markets without much competition. But for venture-backed startups fighting for winner-take-all markets, it's too conservative.

**A Better Approach**

Instead of a fixed 3:1 ratio, use different targets based on your stage:

* Early stage (0-$10M): Accept 2:1-2.5:1 ratios to grow fast
* Growth stage ($10M-$50M): Aim for 3.5:1-4:1 while staying aggressive
* Mature stage ($50M+): Target 4:1-5:1, but still invest in new opportunities

**The Real Metric That Matters**

Focus on payback period, not just the ratio. A 2:1 ratio that pays back in 6 months beats a 4:1 ratio that takes 18 months to pay back.

**Bottom Line**

The 3:1 rule became popular because it's simple and makes investors comfortable. But the companies winning markets aren't following simple rules. They're making smart decisions based on their specific situation, competition, and growth stage.

Don't optimize for investor comfort. Optimize for winning your market."

I understand I only have 3 years experience but the MSP I previously worked for gave me a lot of exposure, I've done everything from firewalls to servers to MS365, Accounting software etc.

There is still room to grow for me in IT definitely but with starting an MSP I feel as if I can get it along the way, or well just completely deviate from that route and become a businessman which is most likely what I'm going to do. 

Now when it comes to knowing how to start a business, I've researched and googled everything I need to know or well that I think is relevant, I would also assume that the best way to learn is to do. I've read online that most msps don't make it due to poor financial decisions so my aim is to cover up on all the aspects that make an msp fail, I feel as if the IT experience is not the issue, its me starting my first company.

I've taken time off work to see this through, I know its gonna take a while, I've been cold calling as well and honestly that's been going well so far, even tho I haven't gotten any clients but its the mental victories that count, I did get a few ""We will see the next finincial year or send me an email""  I know those are just brush offs but it's still something.

“I need a real web-shop, not a Squarespace toy. Books, prints, merch, Stripe + PayPal, worldwide shipping, blog, the works.”
I send my usual offer:

 • 5 custom pages (home, catalog, cart, checkout, blog)
 • Full WooCommerce setup, 20 products uploaded for them
 • Stripe & PayPal live on day one
 • Free hosting for 12 months + business email + Google Business profile
 • Logo clean-up thrown in
 • 30 days of maintenance (I handle plugin updates, backups, broken-links patrol)
One-time price: $349.

Client ghosts for 24 h, then:

“Honestly, your price scares me. Three other quotes were $500-800 for a single landing page that doesn’t even send contact forms to email. If you deliver everything for $349, where’s the catch? Are you outsourcing to Pakistan? Will my site disappear next month?”

I showed live sites, video testimonials, even screenshared the WHM account to prove I host everything on my own VPS. Nope—“too good to be true” was the final verdict. They went with the $500 one-pager that literally has a broken mobile menu (I checked).

So here I am, watching $349 get rejected for being too cheap while the expensive, half-broken option wins.

Legal advice,CorrectRice6232,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0abhu/legal_advice/,"Hi all, in a kind of fortunate way this is the 1st time in 16yrs I’ve faced this issue, so am at a little bit of a loss - I’ll try keep the background simple & not go off on a tangent! 

(UK based) 
We’ve been subcontracting to another business for several years, few late payments but nothing out of the ordinary. Then several months ago, outsourcing suddenly stopped, along with payments due in - leaving a 60k (rounded, inc VAT) debt. Around 1 week later we noticed a whirlwind ripping through the industry that HMRC have ordered their winding up, with receivers appointed etc. 

We followed instruction with registering the debt with HMRC etc, and last week received a notice that basically the business is many millions in debt & put simply were not going to be looking at receiving anything from the winding up process. 

Here’s the thing, we do still hold a limited amount of the businesses stock, amounting to maybe 10k which I know isn’t going to clear the debt, but will help us towards the shortfalls. 

My question is, how do we begin the process of legally taking ownership of that stock? Do we need to initially raise the debt in a small claims court (I’m assuming this is pointless due to the winding up order). Is there a process where we can log a claim to rights log lien on the goods without chasing the debt? 

I know it’s a messy situation, so not straight forward. Also if anyone know of someone in the UK (solicitor) etc, that specialises in this kind of thing then let me know - that could be a help…. I’m just mindful that legal costs quickly rack up & possibly outweigh the value of the stock held.

Most of the time it comes down to a few simple things getting overlooked.

The biggest one is targeting keywords that sound good but nobody actually searches for. Like a plumber optimizing for ""residential plumbing solutions"" when people just type ""plumber near me"" into Google. There's a disconnect between business language and how real customers search.

Slow loading sites get buried no matter how good the content is. If your site takes forever to load on phones, Google's going to rank you lower. Usually it's just images that need compressing or too much code slowing things down.

Technical stuff matters more than people think. If search engines can't properly crawl your site because of sitemap issues or broken configurations, your content never gets indexed properly in the first place.

Having zero backlinks is like having zero credibility in Google's eyes. Other sites linking to you signals that you're legit and trustworthy. Without any, you're basically invisible for competitive searches.

For local businesses, Google Business Profile is huge but most people just claim it and forget about it. Keeping it updated and responding to reviews actually impacts your rankings.

Honestly most SEO problems aren't complicated, they're just basics that get skipped. Everyone wants advanced tricks when the foundation isn't even solid.

Where do you go after you have accomplished THAT main goal?,ThomasC2C,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0cx32/where_do_you_go_after_you_have_accomplished_that/," ****serious post only****

Hi,

First time posting in here.

I was wandering if any of you have experienced some sort of low or “boredom” after you have accomplished your main goal.

To give you some context, just like everyone here, I had a professional goal that have been stirring and defining my life for about 20 years.

I work in the hospitality industry and I have worked all my life to be in the position that I am today. Every single decision I made and every discussion I have had in my life has been looking towards that direction.

In a way it’s great that it is working as for now as I was under a great amount of pressure of course.

But since this main goal has been reached I have been experiencing a change in mood and I do feel boredom. I am less “out for the kill”, less motivated. It sounds silly but it’s true.

I will be interested to know if some of you have gone through the same thing and if yes how did you cope?

 Thanks

We’ve been running some tests using our tool, a tool that connects Google Sheets to WhatsApp. It lets you send personalized messages directly from your Sheet, using variables like {Name}, {Offer}, or {Due Date}.  
  
**Early Observations from Our Users:**  
  
\- One small business team saved about 5 hours a day by switching to semi-automated sending.  
  
\- Personalized fields (like first name + product type) made messages feel more individual, even when automated.  
  
\- Random time gaps between sends reduced the risk of being flagged by WhatsApp.

I'm looking for a Co-Founder,oiblemba,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0clob/im_looking_for_a_cofounder/,"Heyo, so I've recently realized that I am very good at launching projects quickly, but not so good at keeping my focus on them. I guess it's my ADHD making me seek dopamine and building something new just gives the biggest hit. Well I recently launched a pretty cool project (I hope) and I feel it has good potential, but knowing myself there is a high chance I'll just shove it in a drawer of countless other projects I started and it feels wrong, so I thought ""what if I find someone who is good at the stuff I am not so good at"" and maybe we can make it work. 

So I am looking for a Co-Founder to bring some accountability for myself and to not waste this project. I need someone who can do the sales, marketing, etc., I will fully cover the technical part. The project is live, we can literally go ahead and sell, the product is created, it's a pretty simple one, and the value proposition is clear. It's a physical product and there are no upfront costs, not a high ticket product but the margins are nice (100% or more).

The target markets for this product are: hotels, restaurants, cafes, co-working spaces, conference venues, airbnbs. 

We can split the profit 5050, or whatever other way, we can discuss it. 

I don't want to advertise the project here so if this sounds interesting to you let's get in touch via DM. "

Built a small MVP to test an idea — a tool that helps companies track important dates (like SSL certs, inspections, contract renewals, etc.) and automatically reminds the right person before something expires.

We’ve done 100+ demos for our B2B SaaS but no one converts .what am I missing?,WayTraditional2959,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0hn0b/weve_done_100_demos_for_our_b2b_saas_but_no_one/,"Hey folks,

I could really use some perspective from people who’ve been through the B2B SaaS grind.

We’ve built a B2B SaaS product (automation/testing domain) and have done 100+ demos so far. Most prospects genuinely like what they see they say things like “this looks great”, “that’s interesting”, etc. But the problem is:

👉 Hardly anyone signs up for a trial after the demo.

👉 Even the ones who do sign up rarely complete the trial or POC.

👉 It’s been 8 months, and we still haven’t closed a single paid client.

We’ve been consistently following up via email and LinkedIn, trying to keep conversations warm, but most of them just fizzle out after the demo.

So, I’m trying to figure out what’s going wrong here. Some possibilities I’m thinking about:

Maybe the pain point isn’t strong enough or urgent enough?

Could it be pricing, onboarding friction, or trust issues since we’re new?

Or maybe we’re not giving them a clear enough ROI or use case to act on?

If you’ve built or sold a B2B SaaS before what were the biggest blockers you faced between demo → trial → paying user?

And what worked for you to fix that gap?

Any real-world insights, examples, or frameworks you’ve used to improve trial conversions would mean a lot. 🙏

Thanks in advance!"

However, my company is still new — I don’t have an official website yet. We currently sell mainly through e-commerce platforms and social media.

So my questions are:

\- Can I use my Facebook page URL as the business website for now?

\- For a new small business, what’s the best and most cost-effective path to build an online presence?

\- Should I start with Google Business, a simple landing page, or invest in a full website and legal registration later?

My goal is to grow sustainably and reach more customers without overspending early on.

I have built an AI automation that won’t take anybody’s job,Turbulent-Height-823,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0hc9x/i_have_built_an_ai_automation_that_wont_take/,"I’m a consultant and coach (yes I dread the Big4 for reasons I’m not gonna get into in this post), and after months of blood and tears I’m finally gaining some traction.

And to gain traction means booking meetings, which I don’t always love (sometimes I can be an awkward dude), but it’s part of what I signed up for.

After each meeting, I like sending a follow-up sharing some more value and setting the client up for our next meeting.

Last week, it was my first time having two meetings in a row.

Usually I send an immediate follow-up, but this time I couldn’t.

Long story short, after the second meeting I forgot to send the first follow-up.

What did this imply? Did I lose the client? No, but it was an annoying hiccup in the customer journey which I didn’t anticipate.

What I did is I built an AI workflow to handle this.

It automatically pulls attendees from my calendar, drafts a personalized email, and gets it ready to send within minutes after my meetings.

No more forgetting a letter in the recipient’s address that could result in my email being sent into the void, no more copy-pasting, no more wrong attachment.

Will this replace anyone or completely disrupt the world?

Probably no, it will simply do what AI is supposed to do in the first place, freeing time for boring and repetitive stuff and allow humans to focus on what matters."

Here’s the workflow that’s been working:

1. I use AI to write trade-specific copy and pull stock images.


2. A drag-and-drop builder handles layout + mobile optimization.


3. Zapier connects payments → delivery → follow-up email.


4. Clients pay $99, fill a short form, and get their live link in 24 hours.



What surprised me is how many local businesses still don’t have a site or can’t edit their old one — this solves that in one day.

To give you a bit of a background, I started a small design agency a couple of years ago with my partner. It makes a decent yearly wage for a single person so to supplement the income I started working a job full time about 2 years ago. It’s been great because it took care of the financial stress, but at the same time, I have a lot less time to invest in the business. We get most clients through organic marketing, blogs mostly, I do the sales calls and on-boarding and my partner handles everything else. 

I know I can grow this business more and I have a ton of ideas. We are in a profitable niche and now have a good portfolio. I’d say 85% of the calls I get on, I book. 

But I’m feeling stuck. My partner, who is the one doing the actual work, is feeling overwhelmed and can’t really handle more projects. I suggested we hire someone but she finds it hard to delegate. 

I feel like I have everything I need to grow but am staying stagnant. I constantly come up with ways to improve the business but can’t find the time to implement, so the ideas stay shelved and I continue to move at the same snail pace. 

I’d love to find a mentor to guide me through this, but I don’t know how and where.

A couple of months ago, I bought a Chrome extension that had 6,000 users and a 4.7 rating. Since then, I’ve grown it to 7,000 users and it has made $12,000 in just 50 days.

Recently, I acquired Kagaz App. It had no revenue, but I really liked the idea and the design.

How Service Businesses Can Build a Powerful Referral Network,Tycoonstory2020,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0bwe6/how_service_businesses_can_build_a_powerful/,"I’ve learned something powerful over the years of running a service business:

**Growth doesn’t come from ads — it comes from people.**

Every great project I’ve landed, every opportunity that changed my business, started with a *referral* — someone who trusted me enough to recommend my work.

But here’s the secret:  
Referrals don’t just *happen*.  
They’re built — intentionally — through trust, consistency, and genuine relationships.

That’s why I wrote this new article for **Businesstories**, sharing a complete, step-by-step roadmap to help service businesses build their own **referral network** — one that delivers steady, high-quality clients without relying on paid marketing.

In it, I talk about:  
✅ How to identify your best referral partners  
✅ Simple ways to make referring effortless  
✅ How to nurture relationships that last years, not months  
✅ And how to create a referral ecosystem that grows on its own

If you run a consultancy, agency, design studio, or any client-facing business — this is for you.

What's the difference between an AI prototype and an MVP?,Founder_GenAIProtos,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o0d3nk/whats_the_difference_between_an_ai_prototype_and/,"Let's keep it simple 

* A prototype is like a quick sketch. It answers ""Can we even build this?"" It's just to see if the idea works, even if it's ugly on the inside.

* An MVP is like the first, simplest version of the real product. It answers ""Should we build this?"" and is good enough for real users to try.

I see too many people spending months building an MVP when a few days on a prototype could have saved them a ton of time. Has anyone else made this mistake?"

5. The email is sent.

6. If a reply is received, the AI automatically replies to the email ensuring you don't have to manually look it up.

Besides the decreased mileage, I have also encountered other engine-related issues since switching to E20.

I am running a cloud kitchen and we tried to keep the Costs thats economical for a Tier 2 city but, the fuel has had me thinking I have to refill every second day now.

To cope with this, I have started using additives offered at petrol pumps, but this only increases the cost, making it even more difficult to manage. Given the high frequency of tank refills, my overall expenses have skyrocketed, which is a big problem since my business depends on cost-efficiency. If I raise my service charges to cover the increased fuel cost, the number of orders decreases, creating a tight situation for me.

I would like to ask the community if anyone has found effective bypasses or solutions or Mods that i can take up with Mechanic to avoid these issues with E20 fuel while keeping the vehicle mileage reasonable.

Event agencies/venues — how do you tell if a AV quote is fair or inflated?,YSBlue,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0a8d0/event_agenciesvenues_how_do_you_tell_if_a_av/,"Hey guys — I’m working on a small tool and wanted to sanity-check it before I go too far.

As an event agency/event space one of the biggest headaches is comparing AV supplier quotes. Every company sends their own format — some bundle kit, some separate everything, some include labor, while others don’t. 

This doesn't apply if you have a preferred supplier etc - I'm talking small to mid-sized agencies/venues who may otherwise have to request quotes from multiple AV providers.

The idea I’m exploring is a tool that:

* Reads supplier quotes (PDF or docx)
* Highlights pricing differences or odd line items
* Summarises where you might be over- or under-charged
* Report with insights to go back and negotiate on price?

Basically, a faster way to spot unfair or inflated pricing without needing to break out a spreadsheet or engage with loads of suppliers.

Before I build too deep — how do you currently handle this?  
Would something like this save you real time or not really worth it?

Would love brutally honest feedback — what’s the reality?"

For example, I’ve noticed:

Chat-based builders rarely handle backend + logic well.

Most tools make “AI coding” feel more complex than actual coding.

Collaboration and versioning are still painful.

What Small Business Owners Can Learn from Andrew Carnegie’s Story,Business_bulletin,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0htol/what_small_business_owners_can_learn_from_andrew/,"Let’s rewind a bit — long before startups, venture capital, and flashy IPOs, there was Andrew Carnegie. The man who started as a poor Scottish immigrant working in a cotton factory, earning barely a dollar a week… and ended up building one of the biggest business empires in history — the Carnegie Steel Company.

Now, you might be wondering, “Okay, but what does a 19th-century steel tycoon have to do with my small business in 2025?”

Honestly? A lot more than you’d think.

Carnegie’s story isn’t just about steel — it’s about systems, strategy, and mindset. The same fundamentals that make or break modern small businesses today.

Here’s what I mean.

When Carnegie started out, he didn’t have massive funding or fancy connections. What he did have was an obsession with efficiency. He looked at every process in his factory and asked — “Can this be done faster, cheaper, or smarter?” That mindset — the constant drive to improve operations — is what scaled his company when others were just surviving.

If you run a small business, this lesson is gold. Most entrepreneurs try to grow by adding more — more products, more ads, more people. Carnegie grew by optimizing what he already had.

He also mastered networking before networking was a thing. He built deep relationships with railroad companies, suppliers, and even competitors — turning potential rivals into allies. Small business owners often underestimate how far relationships can take you. Sometimes, collaboration beats competition.

Another key takeaway? He reinvested relentlessly. Every profit Carnegie made went back into improving machinery, expanding capacity, or buying competitors. Small businesses often fall into the trap of taking profits too early — Carnegie played the long game.

And here’s something rarely talked about — Carnegie wasn’t born a business genius. He learned by observing others, reading constantly, and staying curious. He believed self-education was the best investment. For any small business owner, that’s still true today. Reading business stories, studying case studies, or understanding financial systems — these things compound over time, just like investments.

Of course, Carnegie’s empire wasn’t built without challenges. He faced economic downturns, labor strikes, and brutal competition. But instead of panicking, he adapted. He saw crises as signals to innovate.

So if your small business is struggling right now — maybe sales are slow or competition is eating into your market — remember this: the biggest empires were born during tough times. What matters is whether you use the storm to learn or to quit.

Carnegie once said, “The man who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take possession of anything else to which he is justly entitled.”

That’s as relevant to us today as it was back then.

Whether you’re running a coffee shop, an agency, or an e-commerce brand, Carnegie’s playbook still applies — master efficiency, build relationships, reinvest, and keep learning.

That’s how small businesses become unbreakable.

Advice on equity split for start up,PlentyOccasion4582,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o07fgd/advice_on_equity_split_for_start_up/,"I have been talking this person that has an idea and it's working on it. I'm a technical person.

They want me to be the CTO. However they are really into ""AI"". I don't know if they know what they really want I think they sold that to the investors. But basically they want a platform where they can gather information about the artist projects and then give a great summary of what it is and give a prediction on whether it will succeed or not.

I don't see this as the new ""AI"" as in LLMs and so on. I see it as a normal algorithm. I can't find the need for LLms here or even ML here right now. It's a simple platform.

They have done work, met potential investors and have a big list of artis, have advisors in law etc.

So that is the background.

Now they said that they need a CTO and they want to also get someone in AI to co-found with me. So it will be 4 of us. They want to split the ""technical"" part of it.

Right now they are proposing 10% for me as a CTO because they also want a AI person too.

After each meeting, I like sending a follow-up sharing some more value and setting the client up for our next meeting.



Last week, it was my first time having two meetings in a row.



Usually I send an immediate follow-up, but this time I couldn’t.



Long story short, after the second meeting I forgot to send the first follow-up.



What did this imply? Did I lose the client? No, but it was an annoying hiccup in the customer journey which I didn’t anticipate.

  
What I did is I built an AI workflow to handle this.



It automatically pulls attendees from my calendar, drafts a personalized email, and gets it ready to send within minutes after my meetings.



No more forgetting a letter in the recipient’s address that could result in my email being sent into the void, no more copy-pasting, no more wrong attachment.



Will this replace anyone or completely disrupt the world?



Probably no, it will simply do what AI is supposed to do in the first place, freeing time for boring and repetitive stuff and allow humans to focus on what matters."

- preset adresses with earliest/latest delivery times. Also set the needed capacity per adress.
  
- toggle customers to inactive if they don't get food delivered at the moment
  
- distribute all active adresses between the selected preset routes and cars in the given parameters.
(If we have the feeling there should be less routes, because some of our customers are closed atm, we should be able to tell the program to distribute between only the preset routes we selected)

Inherited a small business. HELP,PsychologicalLink311,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nzqe9y/inherited_a_small_business_help/,"Hello everyone,

I am hoping to find some help from small business owners. My father passed in June and he owned a towing company. It was a one man show that he built over the past 20 years. Unfortunately, I have no driver and am losing customers. For the first three months of taking over my dad's business, I did have a driver. So there was a little income. However, I am seeing a loss now in profits. My questions are...what steps do I take on selling this company? The phone number was his personal and his business number, how do I find out the value of this? Do I hire a broker? Appraiser? Lawyer? 
In no way am I capable running this company since I have no knowledge about the automotive world nor the business world. Please help. "

I am going through Alex Hormozi's $100M Offer.

Problem: I overthought about the ""dream outcome"" and realised that people in my industry want their stocks' price to do well as the end-all-be-all. That's all they ultimately care about. However, what I want to do will have a limited impact on that overall outcome and will help them with discovery and some positive brand association at best. Should I then pivot my dream outcome to be ""be popular amongst relevant audience on a positive note"" instead of ""your stock price will shoot up"" considering latter is a much bigger and complex problem to solve?

Context: I want to make video content for companies in my industry. Basically, do marketing for them, get them awareness, get them a reliable base of users/customers from my audience. I plan on growing my audience by talking about my industry in general which is retail and business focused (like individuals and companies alike consume content and can directly interact within the industry).

Advice Needed for a Small Cloud kitchen Delivery system ( Any mods in engine or vehicle that can help me save fuel ),IcyLow9565,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o06rxi/advice_needed_for_a_small_cloud_kitchen_delivery/,"I have been using the recently introduced E20 fuel in the market for about a month or two, and unfortunately, it has severely damaged my vehicle's mileage. My 2020 Activa 5G, which is my primary mode of transport for delivery, has faced a significant drop in fuel average nearly 40%. Besides the decreased mileage, I have also encountered other engine-related issues since switching to E20.

I am running a cloud kitchen and we tried to keep the Costs thats economical for a Tier 2 city but, the fuel has had me thinking I have to refill every second day now.

To cope with this, I have started using additives offered at petrol pumps, but this only increases the cost, making it even more difficult to manage. Given the high frequency of tank refills, my overall expenses have skyrocketed, which is a big problem since my business depends on cost-efficiency. If I raise my service charges to cover the increased fuel cost, the number of orders decreases, creating a tight situation for me.

I would like to ask the community if anyone has found effective bypasses or solutions or Mods that i can take up with Mechanic to avoid these issues with E20 fuel while keeping the vehicle mileage reasonable. Any advice or experience would be greatly appreciated as the rising fuel costs are putting a lot of financial stress on  businesses like mine.

Someone asked for my 4-step framework for finding a 'boring' SaaS idea that actually solves a problem. Here it is.,AlexeyAnshakov,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o09mqz/someone_asked_for_my_4step_framework_for_finding/,"The other day, I commented on a Reddit post about finding business ideas, and someone left the next follow-up question:

""Love the simplicity of this idea, and the value prop is so clear and obvious. How did you identify this opportunity? What was your process/approach?""

I decided to share it as a standalone post.

For context, my example was a ""boring SaaS"" I built for B2B auto parts distributors. They lose money because they're too slow to answer quote emails. My tool hooks into their Google Sheet inventory and replies in under 30 seconds.

Here's the 4-step process I used to find and validate this idea.

1. Listen

It started with a conversation. A friend who owns a small distribution business was complaining that he loses deals because he's physically on the floor packing boxes and misses quote request calls/emails. The pain wasn't ""I need an AI,"" it was ""I'm losing money while I'm busy.""

2. Validate

I spent a few days searching, learning, and speaking to other small distributors in different niches (HVAC, auto parts, industrial supplies). I didn't pitch anything, just asked: ""how do you handle incoming quote requests, and how fast do you typically respond?"" Almost everyone said it's a manual process and a major bottleneck.

3. Quantify the cost of ""doing nothing"".

I found the industry stats (78% of sales go to the first responder, average reply time is 47 hours. Perplexity helps a lot). Now the problem had a dollar value. It wasn't a ""nice-to-have"" anymore; it was a leaking bucket of money.

4. Build the 'dumbest' solution.

Sometime ago I built a ""Process-as-a-Service"" (PraaS) engine that allows me to link web forms with automation tools like n8n (I could write a whole separate post just on the tech stack).

But the first version was literally a workflow that did one thing: watch an inbox, find a VIN in the text, look it up in a single Google Sheet, and paste the price into a pre-written email. That's it. It solved 80% of the problem with 20% of the effort.

So that's the whole philosophy: find a painful, unglamorous problem, quantify the cost of not solving it, and then build the simplest possible thing to stop the bleeding."

"Business has generated lots of money, but is now stuck.",SaiyanGodOW,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzf9mh/business_has_generated_lots_of_money_but_is_now/,"I’m 26 years old and have been building my business with my team for about a year now. We operate in the e-casino niche and have recently surpassed $300k in total deposits, with around 1,000 registered users. Our best month so far brought in roughly $20k USD in profit.

We’re now at an inflection point, our growth has been almost entirely organic up to this stage, but scaling further will require strategic partnerships and additional resources. Marketing in our space is heavily driven by affiliates and content creators, yet most of the major influencers are being monopolized by a few competing platforms. Because of this, we’re often faced with inflated promotion costs, anywhere from $200 to over $1,000 for a brief 30-minute collaboration.

Most would probably think we could just work with the same influencers we have been and save up money, but even creators we've partnered with in the past have since been acquired and now demand outrageous prices for what may, or may not bring us valuable users. 

It’s clear there’s a bubble forming in the niche, and we’re carefully evaluating how to navigate it sustainably.

Should we bite the bullet and pay these inflated rates? Or find an alternative route to attain more funding.

Graveyard of bad ideas (long),EntropyLab,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzl7py/graveyard_of_bad_ideas_long/,"I’m a startup mentor/advisor, board member, investor, and have worked with accelerators as well as university startup programs. Everyone who works in this industry has a mental list of bad ideas that we have seen hundreds of times, that always fail (with *very rare* exceptions). 

If you’re an aspiring entrepreneur, especially if you don’t have the ability to bootstrap or self-fund your startup, you should be aware that it will be very hard to get investors, seasoned co-founders, and other industry pros to take you seriously with these concepts. 

This post is not meant to discourage you from building something you’re passionate about! Your friends and family have probably been excited to hear your idea. You probably think you have a special approach to this thing that nobody else has thought of. If you see it on this list, chances are that it has been tried thousands of times by other founders, and you just never hear about them because they never break into the public consciousness. (Leaving out dropshipping type side hustles and last-generation hype ideas like blockchain for xyz.) 

If you are able to bootstrap, you may still be able to build a healthy small business out of it! If you live in a country where the wave of certain products like this haven’t hit yet, you may be able to localize the idea. **But be honest with yourself about why a big competitor is not already doing it, or whether your concept has serious distribution, behavioral, economic, or structural friction built in.** 

* A better social media app. 
   * Yes, a lot of people are unhappy with the current social media giants. They are toxic, increasingly filled with AI slop, and use your data in shady ways. And yet, you will not get enough people to switch to your healthy, friendly, safe version unless you can get major celebrities/influencers to use it and spend crazy amounts of money on advertising. LinkedIn is annoying in different ways, but you’re not replacing that either.
* The all in one life organizer app. 
   * Users already have habits and nobody wants to switch to your unified dashboard. Whatever value you’re offering, it is probably smaller than the inconvenience of moving contacts, messages, calendar holds, etc. and retraining their brain to a new workflow.
* The app that lets you make group plans, split group bills, and fix group coordination annoyance. 
   * Or any related idea that text or Whatsapp messages and simple payment tools already do. Before you start, do a search for existing solutions. Have you ever used these? Probably not. 
* Dating app for \[niche group or location\].
   * It’s basically a right of passage to build one of these in your college dorm as you’re fuming over not getting dates. Build it for fun, build it to impress that one guy/girl, but don’t count on reinventing this industry. 
* AI that does \[things the big players are already building\]. 
   * If your AI product promises to be a life coach, mentor, co-founder, business ideator, marketing copywriter, summarizer for emails/meetings/PDFs, or some other successful use case of AI, the big tech companies are already getting these users. You need a serious technical edge or marketing wizardry to outsmart them, and a moat to keep users when OpenAI decides to copy you. 
* AI that does \[a highly regulated, complex thing in legal, accounting, healthcare, etc.\]. 
   * This is not a complete graveyard group of ideas, but one with a big asterisk. Unless you’re a professional with decades of experience doing this thing, you can’t customer discovery your way into a solution. If you’re on the tech side, bring on a co-founder with direct experience doing the thing or partner with an SMB that does this thing so you can get feedback and iterate on outputs. It will be a long, grueling slog to build the solution to a ‘good enough’ place that other companies will trust your product. Selling it will be equally hard, because every business is getting spammed with half assed solutions that promise the moon. 
* Ethical/sustainable/local ecommerce.
   * Totally rational idea, in theory a lot of people would prefer an alternative to Amazon, etc. But like any marketplace you need a critical mass of people on both sides (sellers/buyers), with the added limitation that now both sellers and buyers have to be interested in and prove that they’re ethical/sustainable/local/etc.
* Subscription box for \[something\]
   * Unless it’s wildly unique, CAC will kill you. 

* Slack / Notion / Asana but \[simpler, cooler, with AI\]
   * Switching costs are greater than whatever you’re selling. Your idea for how to improve these is likely a feature that the big guys can copy if it takes off. 
* Uber for \[a type of labor\]. Airbnb for \[random thing\]. Marketplace for renting \[something\]. 
   * Peer to peer only works when both peers exist in density. Are you tech washing a service that doesn’t actually scale? Is there enough repeat usage? The wave for copying these concepts has largely passed. 
* AI powered recruiting platform. AI powered job applicant support. 
   * Everyone that’s applied to a job in the last 2 years has experienced the hell that this process has become. But also, every HR department gets pitched tools like this anytime they post a job. AI doesn’t magically create more jobs or make candidate pools better, so you’ll likely just add to the noise. 
* Corporate wellness and team engagement platform.
   * Add to this ideas to manage company swag, gifts, events, diversity in recruitment, etc. Unfortunately companies do not want to invest a ton in these things, nor do they want to experiment with switching vendors. Even if you tell them their retention will go up X%. While employers have the upper hand in the job market, they will be unlikely to spend money on these. 

There are a ton more of these in education (AI tutors!), healthtech (app that reminds you to drink water!), productivity (app that beats procrastination!), basically all domains, but you get the idea. 

No judgment if your startup falls into one of these categories, I’ve been guilty of it. Critically think through where your concept will hit friction, and be honest with yourself whether you have a solid way of overcoming it. "
Why AI entrepreneurship is becoming the fastest-growing path for new founders,SilverCandyy,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1o08o31/why_ai_entrepreneurship_is_becoming_the/,"If you’ve been thinking about starting something on your own, AI entrepreneurship might be one of the best entry points right now. Unlike traditional startups, AI-driven businesses often need less upfront investment, can scale faster, and solve real-world problems using automation and data.

Here’s what new entrepreneurs should focus on:
	1.	Start small, automate smart: You don’t need to build a huge AI system. Begin with micro-tools or automation agents that solve one specific problem.
	2.	Use open-source models & APIs: Platforms like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Stability AI make it easier than ever to build powerful products without massive infrastructure.
	3.	Validate before you build big: Launch MVPs, collect feedback fast, and iterate speed matters more than perfection.
	4.	Focus on distribution: Even great AI tools fail without users. Leverage Reddit, Product Hunt, and LinkedIn for visibility.
	5.	Build transparency & trust: Users are getting smarter about AI. Clearly show what’s automated and how data is handled.

We’re still early in the AI revolution the ones who experiment now will likely lead in the next few years.

I hear a lot of people say to ""just start"" and figure things out as you go. And I totally get that mindset, but I'm having some difficulties with the beginning phase. I come up with some ideas, and start planning things, but when I get hung up on is the paperwork side. I start second guessing on what I need to get started. After I get the idea, and think of how to get the product going, should I be filing paperwork with the government before selling anything? Should I get a DBA just to get started, or get an LLC even though I don't know how big this thing will be. Do I get an EIN or wait on that for now? Do I get a business checking account, or just start selling something and if it gets bigger, get one later? Is it okay to get a website and email address without a DBA or LLC, and is it alright to sell things for now without those, and get them after I start? 

I just get worried I may mess something up, and if something does relatively well, I want it to be sustainable and not be screwed up because I didn't do something correct in the beginning. How do people ""just start"" on this side of the entrepreneurship side? Do you all just get a website, sell some stuff, and then if it seems to have legs, do all the paperwork side then?

Seeking Rec's for LA-based Entertainment Accountant(s),bye-standard,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzv5e1/seeking_recs_for_labased_entertainment_accountants/,"Hi All! I'm currently in the market for a very-specific type of accountant. I'm a consultant/freelancer turned small business based in Los Angeles (specifically in entertainment), and I've been using the same accountant throughout my years as a freelancer. They're a personal recommendation from a family member, who has some pretty sketchy business practices (imo).

As I've started to take my business dealings more seriously, I've also started to take my finances (and understanding them) more seriously as well. There have been a number of red flags raised over the last few years regarding this current accountant, as well as missed information that has caused me to be the target of some late fees -- thankfully, nothing major. But I want to get ahead of it while the fees are still small. 

I believe they're great for your average Joe, but I need a little more transparency and understanding of these processes, as I'm often not as familiar with them -- trying to run a business and all.

Any recommendations and personal experiences would be greatly appreciated."
Got decent SEO rankings with AI help but conversions suck - what else can I try?,subsweeperfan,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzv1lx/got_decent_seo_rankings_with_ai_help_but/,"hey r/entrepreneur 👋

so I run subscription tracker web app called subsweeper (helps people find forgotten subscriptions). been struggling with getting users without spending money on ads.

tried the whole AI content thing - basically took top articles about subscription management, fed them to chatgpt, generated like 15 articles for different keywords (""how to cancel netflix"" etc).

results:

* got some decent rankings (page 1-2 for several keywords)
* organic traffic up maybe 40% over few months
* BUT people just read and leave, barely anyone signs up

tried the usual stuff - better call-to-actions, some lead magnets, internal links. still not working great.

english isn't my first language and I'm doing this solo, so maybe I'm missing something obvious?

question: what organic channels actually work for saas tools besides SEO?

tired of burning money on google ads. need some ideas that don't require huge budget but willing to put in work.

any suggestions? thanks"

When do Startup Founders start considering setting up a sales system?,Few-Pound-8786,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzoqld/when_do_startup_founders_start_considering/,"I wanted to connect with startup founders and understand when does it become important for them to set up a proper sales system for their products. I'd love to know:

1. If you have investors onboard, when do they start expecting you to have paying customers lined up for the product?
2. Do you start with referrals, look for those first customers and then move on to set up a proper business development system (and hire people)? Or do you prefer to have a system upfront that connects with you with your prospective customers as you build?
3. When you think about setting up a system, do you prefer to do your business development efforts on Linkedin, Email or physical platforms like conferences?
4. How do you hire your first Business Development person? I am hearing Founder AE a lot nowadays. Is that something you're doing for your startup. Or is your focus on building a system first and then someone onboard to operate/manage it?

Looking forward for your responses."
Engagement ring storefront advice,bugsluttt,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzu9rz/engagement_ring_storefront_advice/,"I’m working on an idea for a small engagement ring store in a religious college town (thousands of engagements a year) that focuses on lab-grown diamond engagement rings.

I don’t have a background in jewelry, but I do have a lot of experience in starting and running multiple other businesses and specialize in marketing and sales.  I think there’s an opportunity here for something fresh and affordable in my area.

The general idea is to use a supplier like Stuller to order finished rings and lab-grown diamonds once a customer chooses their setting and specs. The shop itself would mostly have demo rings and sample stones so people can try things on and see different styles in person. The goal is to make it feel high-end but still budget-friendly without needing a massive amount of inventory or an in-house jeweler. I’d mainly act as the retail face and local brand, not a full custom jeweler. Basically the thought is to be reselling through a trusted supplier instead of manufacturing or setting stones myself, and using only lab grown diamonds to keep rings as affordable as possible for young couples still in college.

I’m trying to figure out if this model actually makes sense before diving in too deep.A few questions for those that know this industry: Is building out a storefront without doing my own bench work realistic?I’ve heard Stuller is amazing to work with, any other companies like them to look into? Any other red flags or advice for someone new to jewelry but strong in sales/branding? Appreciate any insight, I’m trying to make this a legitimate business, not a gimmick, but I also want to keep it lean and modern.  Im extremely scrappy and love to hustle but also acknowledge I have zero experience in this industry and would love an honest perspective.  Thank you!"

"They paid employees’ rent, pulled off Christmas miracles, and built a ""second chance"" workplace. Then Long Island’s “DQ Sisters” were blindsided by a little-known pay law.",kleverrboy,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzykpy/they_paid_employees_rent_pulled_off_christmas/,"Support is swelling for two Long Island sisters who poured their savings into a Dairy Queen franchise, only to find themselves blindsided by a little-known pay law.

The case centered on New York’s “Frequency of Pay” law, which requires manual workers to be paid weekly. DeMint and Robey paid employees every two weeks, a practice they said was standard in the industry and even approved by their payroll company.

Still, the lawsuit alleged serious labor violations, and the sisters were eventually forced to settle out of court for $450,000. Of that, more than $300,000 went to attorneys’ fees, while about 200 former employees in the class action each received less than $200.

5 Million+ Revenue Stories,HoneydewOriginal,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzsaub/5_million_revenue_stories/,"Hey everyone, 

2025 has surprised me in so many unpredictable and complex ways that I'm looking to understand if I'm the only one or if everyone's been thrown for a loop

My name is Nik and I own/operate 3 cash flowing businesses (But if you check my post history you will see i have ""Tried building"" about 11 companies in the last 10 years, these are simply the ones that have done well enough to keep going)  

Niche Construction (19 Employees, 4m Revenue Velocity, roughly 13% margins)  
White Label E-Comm Store (1 Employee 2.6m Velocity, last year 20% margins, this year 5%)   
White Label E-Comm Store with exclusive agreement (600k Velocity, last year 25% margins this year 7%)

  
Okay now for Story Time! 

My construction company came 1 inch away from bankruptcy in January as our main revenue stream completely disappeared from the market due to weather conditions in our area.  We took a 150k capital loan in September of 2024 to try to outlast the weather without having to fire any of our team members that we truly loved but the weather outlasted us.  with the combined blunt halt of sales/work coming in and the additional monthly payment from the loan things were ROUGH. My partner and I were hemorrhaging 5k a week each out of our personal savings accounts, in a frenzy I spun up website pages and google ads campaigns for 5 new services we had never offered previously. 2 of those services ended up absolutely blowing up, low cost of leads and project sizes from 15k-100k each job.  Fast forward 10 months and those 2 services are now 65% of our revenue and the service that used to be our main breadwinner has only returned to roughly 20% of our revenue. Learning how to do these 2 new services was not an overnight thing, the first company meeting where we announced we would pivot in this direction happened in December and we are just now fully unlocking them (There are simple projects and there are very complex projects, fully unlocking is referring to taking on the big scary ones) 

In addition to changing the overall services of the company we implemented some EXTREMELY valuable team processes that I believe every people oriented business could benefit from adopting in some way or another:

1. Weekly Leadership Calls (Where all department heads speak on their respective KPI's)   
2. Weekly Company Wide Calls  
3. Front office needs to fill out a spreadsheet everyday tracking how many leads come in vs how many estimates were scheduled and which service they are calling about, also flagging which leads are junk and why they are junk, also tracking how many missed calls in a week, also tracking how many review requests sent out and how many reviews we actually got.  (since lead attribution is never 100% accurate this acts as our source of truth for marketing strategy)  
4. Head of installation spreadsheet every week on total revenue installed and total cost of labor and job complete or not and happy or not, this helps us aim towards high revenue without losing site of how expensive the labor can get and also not send out review requests to not so happy people and also catch early if someone was unhappy to make right before they do something like withhold payment or post a 1 star  
5. Head of Sales spreadsheet every week tracking total leads ran, total revenue sold, closing rate, $ per lead ran, and average deal size, this data is filled in by every rep every week and shows us on a weekly basis everyones stats (And the company stats as a whole) and because its filled in manually we know its 100% accurate even if CRM data isnt perfect.  
6. Back Office invoice tracking, office manager goes over every dollar of outstanding invoices and speaks to why they are outstanding so we can unlock the cash. 

I apologize for the lack of caring for grammar on the above but I believe you will be able to understand it. 

These changes along with opening up the new services has taken an ALMOST bankrupt company to be a lean mean efficient machine generating 40k+ a month in profit.

Okay thats my story for 2025 on the construction business, I have a few on the E-Comm side but they are much less happy as you could imagine.  (But I'm not losing faith in them, just weathering the storm and focusing my energy on the winners) 

**I'm genuinely curious to hear how other 7 figure owners are navigating the business world this year as it is in my opinion different than what I've experienced in the last 10 years.**

You don't have to be willing to share revenue or other metrics but i do believe it adds color to a story and helps understand the context of your situation as problems at 100k a year are very different than problems at 4 million a year. 

Thanks for reading,

Struggle with desk work but thrive in physical work,Amanlikeyou,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzidqz/struggle_with_desk_work_but_thrive_in_physical/,"My side business which is getting close to being my full time focus, is physical.

Whereas my side business is physical. I love to meet and talk to people. Walk them through the products and finally close the sale. There's something so satisfying about that. I would love to grow it to a team of people and not just me.

Check these 5 things if you're not getting enough leads and/or closing sales,north10feet,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nzlpos/check_these_5_things_if_youre_not_getting_enough/,"A lot of founders/ CEOs/ CROs end up “owning” marketing without much of a playbook. If it feels sporadic or you’re not hitting revenue goals, here are the first places I’d look:

1. **ICP clarity:** Do you know exactly who you’re for (and who you’re not) and maybe even more importantly are you focused on **only 1-2?**
2. **Message:** Can you/your people explain the problem you solve in 2 sentences that your buyers actually care about? (not what your product does)
3. **Proof**: Do you have 3 strong proof points (ROI, outcomes, logos) visible everywhere (websites, sales decks, trade show booth walls)?
4. **Pipeline sanity**: Where’s the biggest drop or lag in the funnel? Check your metrics and conversion rates for inbound traffic, lead creation, pipeline/opp creation or close.
5. **Marketing/Sales handoff:** Are leads actually being followed up on quickly and consistently?

Check these first before you build another email campaign or ad. Improving one (or more) of the above makes more of an impact on your targets and creates a more scalable engine.
