I am looking for software that helps me file documents.,kennethberlin,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1o123ds/i_am_looking_for_software_that_helps_me_file/,"Introduction

Some of you are probably familiar with this situation. You want to save a file and start thinking: Where should I save the file?

I now have a structure and a certain routine, while my colleagues save files somewhere on the server. My highlight was when I found out how a colleague had created five folders with the same content on several hard drives. 



Software

My file names are structured as follows:

Category Title Project Company Index or Date

My folders are organized by project

It would be great to have a program (not cloud-based) that asks me to select from a menu when saving: Project --> Click Project Z; Category --> Click; Finally, Title and Index.

When I click on the predefined selection, it gives me a suggestion for the storage path next to the file name. I have defined this in the “program.”



This speeds up filing and prevents files from being stored anywhere.



I haven't found anything yet. Only paperless ngx. I haven't tried that because I work directly on drives and network drives in Windows."

Just built a tool that turns any app into a native Windows service,AdUnhappy5308,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1o11xd4/just_built_a_tool_that_turns_any_app_into_a/,"Hi all,

I built Servy, a Windows tool that lets you turn any app into a native Windows service with full control over working directory, startup type, process priority, logging, health checks, environment variables, dependencies, pre-launch and post-launch hooks, and parameters.

Servy lets you run any executable as a windows service, including Node.js, Python, .NET apps, scripts, and more. It allows you to set a custom working directory to avoid path issues, redirect stdout and stderr to log files with rotation, and includes built-in health checks with automatic recovery and restart policies. The tool features a clean, modern UI for easy service management, and is compatible with Windows 7 through Windows 11 as well as Windows Server.

Servy continuously monitors your app, restarting it automatically if it crashes, hangs, or stops. It is perfect for keeping non-service apps running in the background and ensuring they start automatically at system boot without having to rewrite them as services.

Check it out on GitHub: [https://github.com/aelassas/servy](https://github.com/aelassas/servy)

Any feedback is very welcome."

Lost files,thebe000,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1o0rex1/lost_files/,"(Im writing this here bc some people in r/photography said its not recoverable)
I usually use my SDHC card with my own camera, but recently I put it into a completely different camera and took a few photos with it. The card is only 4GB, and the other camera takes photos that are around 128MB each, so it filled up almost instantly.

After that, I put the card back into my own camera and took a few more pictures. But when I checked the files on my computer, the card seemed half empty — and neither the photos from the other camera nor the ones I took afterward were there.

I later learned that I should’ve formatted the card before using it in another camera. Some of the missing photos still show up when I browse the card through my camera, so they’re not completely gone.

Is there any way to recover those missing photos?"

With Win10 support from Microsoft ending soon and no ability for the laptops to be upgraded to 11, I've been wondering if some functions would be better replaced by something else now. Of course, CommonSense is always the most powerful software but you can never be too safe. At least some virus scanning software would be great, especially if free / open source. Recommendations for that, and any other useful software, are welcome.

[I have considered trying Linux but at least for now there's too much Windows-based I still use on the laptops. By the end of the year I may get another old laptop to possibly experiment with - it was used by my late grandma, then by my late father. I'm sure it's safe.]"

Stay away from iMazing (detail inside),Oddboyz,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nz7nuw/stay_away_from_imazing_detail_inside/,"This is a review on iMazing [3.4.0.6](http://3.4.0.6) free-trial version (the current version as of today).  


**Summary:**   
A total PoS software that can potentially break your device even if you've done things right. You cannot alter/move/delete the files transferred from PC to Apple device. The operation will fail - specifically the app will say it 'cannot detect the album/folder' despite the fact that the albums/folders in question are shown both in the app and the Apple device! Other times, the app will just freeze/run in loop.

Their tech support answer \~90% of the issues with either 'restart your computer', 'restart your Apple device' or 'turn off iCloud service' which obviously did not work based on the users' feedbacks on their forum and here in Reddit.  


**Context:**   
Since Apple has been a total baloney^(\[1\]) of a company that make everything extraordinarily complicated for the general users especially when it comes to cross-platform ^(\[2\]), I've been trying since 2009 to get my old iPad1 to work with simple file import/export (JPG, PNG, PDF and MP4)^(\[3\]).  
  
Yesterday I've noticed a few Reddit users suggesting iMazing app and I decided to give it a shot (obviously my fault for rushing it without diving deep enough).  
  
So I needed to import family photos & some PDF reading materials from my PC to my old iPad1 and then give it to my cousin so she can take it with her on a trip where internet connection might be limited.  


**First impression:**   
iMazing app looks great on windows10, the UI is intuitive & clean and the tooltips pretty well-explain. However, that's the only good thing I've got to say about this broken app.  


**Issues:**   
So I've managed to transfer a PDF file and about 30 photos from my PC to iPad1. ""Hey, that was quite straightforward"" I said to myself.

However, I've made a mistake adding a few irrelevant files to the iPad so I thought ""I'd just delete these"". WRONG! You cannot delete those files. You can see those files on both the app screen and the Apple device, but when you press the delete button the app will either freeze, run in loop or say something like  'cannot detect the album/folder'. And you cannot delete those PDFs/images from your iPad either because there's no delete button for those files.

And since I've exhausted the trial's upper limit while trying to fix the issue, now my iPad1 is stuck with a few junk albums and some embarrassing standalone files  


**Footnotes:**  
\[1\] Lesson learned 6 months after I've purchased my iPad1.  
\[2\] Eg. very simple tasks like basic, direct file transfer between PC and apple devices.  
\[3\] Yes, my ipad1 is still in a very good condition."

Quit construction at 21 for freelancing and it worked out.,sicksarkee,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nyy5l6/quit_construction_at_21_for_freelancing_and_it/,"so im 21 and i run an automation agency now. was doing construction since i was like 17 and honestly thought id do it forever lol

**how it started:** construction was killing my back and i was tired all the time. randomly saw a youtube video about n8n and automation, started learning it at night. took me forever to understand it but i just kept going

started freelancing on upwork and fiverr doing basic stuff. first client paid me $300 for a simple workflow and i was hyped 

**the linkedin automation helped me the most**

this is one automation that helped me find most of the clients.

here's what i built (see the screenshot):

* runs on a schedule every night
* scrapes data with Apollo API thru Http request node.
* AI model scores each lead 1-70 based on their criteria
* only stores the good leads (score 65+)
* Counts pages so it never gets same data.

this was one of the first automations i have built and it has really done me wonders, no matter how simple it is

**things i learned:**

* being 21 with no degree doesnt matter if you solve real problems
* construction actually taught me alot about work ethic and dealing with clients

What AI tool subscriptions do you actually keep?,Ok-Farmer-6264,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nynlel/what_ai_tool_subscriptions_do_you_actually_keep/,"I'm struggling with this right now. I have too many AI tools with overlapping features, and it's getting expensive.

Like, I can't justify paying for ChatGPT Plus, Perplexity Pro, Claude Pro, AND Gemini Pro all at once. But here's the problem - they're each the best at different things, so it's hard to pick just one.

And that's not even counting all the other AI tools out there: Cursor, Windsurf, ElevenLabs, Notion AI, Poe, DeepSeek, Zapier, Canva, Murf AI, and so many more...

So I'm curious - what's your current AI tool stack? Which subscriptions do you actually keep active, and what do you use each one for most of the time?

I need to cut down but don't want to lose the tools I actually need.

Thanks!"

Major issue with recovering 18 TB of project files – need advice,JianZ95,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1ny4lf5/major_issue_with_recovering_18_tb_of_project/,"Hi everyone,  
We’re in a really difficult situation and are hoping someone here might have experience or suggestions.

While using **Carbon Copy Cloner**, a mistake happened where *source* and *destination* were swapped, which unfortunately resulted in a large number of files from our documentary project being deleted/overwritten.

We tried recovering the data with **Disk Drill**, which has been running for several days to recover about **18 TB of data**. It did find a lot of files, but most of them seem to be corrupted – they won’t open or play.

We’re looking for advice on:

* Whether there are **better recovery tools** than Disk Drill for handling this scale of data.
* Recommendations for **professional data recovery services** (preferably in Denmark) with higher success rates.
* Any ways to **repair corrupted video files**, or if that’s generally a lost cause.

Any input would mean a lot – this project is very important, and we want to make sure we’ve tried every possible option before giving up.

"Seeking Advice: Python Keylogger for Child Safety (Features, Improvements, and Ethics)",404unknownerror404,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nxyug7/seeking_advice_python_keylogger_for_child_safety/,"So, my 7-year-old son is getting a gaming PC for Christmas. His mum isn’t the best with computers, and since we’re separated, it’s hard for both of us to keep an eye on him. He’s well above average in computing and maths at school, and he’s joined a coding club, which he enjoys. He’s autistic and trusts people too easily, so I worry he might make mistakes online or be led astray.

I’ve made a small keylogging script with these features:

* **Keystroke Logging with Sentence Buffering:** Captures keystrokes and buffers them into readable sentences, instead of logging every individual letter.
* **Active Window Tracking:** Logs the title of the window or application where typing happens, to give context to the logs.
* **Simple Log File Management:** Rotates the log file when it reaches 1 MB, renaming the old log with a timestamped filename.
* **Trigger Word Detection and Alert Logging:** Checks each logged sentence for predefined trigger words (like “password,” “bully,” etc). When trigger words appear, those entries are saved separately in *trigger\_alerts.txt* for quicker review.
* **Email Alert System (Prepared):** The script includes email alert functionality, but it’s disabled by default. It can be enabled by toggling a switch and configuring email credentials.
* **Special Key Handling:** Handles keys like Space, Enter, Backspace, Tab, and others to keep logs clean and readable.

In the future, as he gets older, I’m considering adding periodic screenshots, but I think that’s too much for now. All logs will be kept local, and email alerts will only be sent when certain trigger words are detected to keep us up to date. Apart from that, it’s intended to run quietly in the background—just as an extra layer of monitoring in case we miss something.

The reason I’m doing this is because, as we all know, the internet has become a breeding ground for people who want to harm children, and big companies aren’t doing enough to stop or limit data breaches. If personal info is stored with them, data privacy is a real concern. I plan to add encryption later, so if anyone does access the logs, they’ll need to decrypt them first. This is all with the full consent of his mother and me (his father).

I’ve created this in my spare time as I’m just starting to learn Python—ChatGPT helped a lot, not going to lie. Any advice or feedback on what to improve or include would be great. I know this isn’t a parenting community, but I’m hoping to develop this further and make it better in the future. Thanks for reading!"
Find your files like in a browser (Like Google Search),EugenioUglov,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nxre2c/find_your_files_like_in_a_browser_like_google/,"I’ve always struggled with finding my own files, even when I tried to keep everything neatly organized with folders, filenames, and tags. At some point it just turned into chaos, and I thought: *why can’t searching files work more like searching the web?*

That idea led me to build a light Windows tool that do exactly that.



What it currently does:

* lets you type plain queries (not only exact filenames)
* ranks results by relevance
* allows adding custom tags
* generates some automatic tags from filename/extension/folder
* lets you attach an image to a file so it’s easier to spot later.

What I’m exploring next:

* AI-based tagging from file content (text, images, etc.)
* context-aware search (understanding the intent of the query)
* smarter filtering and prioritization.



Right now I mainly use it for myself, but I’m curious if others have had the same frustration.

* Do you also find built-in file search limited?
* What do you usually use to solve this problem?

**Seen these 3 mistakes over and over again** that hurt companies or cost 6+ months of rewrites: 

**Premature microservices -** 

3-person team launched with 8 microservices because ""that's what Netflix does.""

Result: 60% of time on DevOps, not features. Ran out of runway.

Fix: Modular monolith first. Split at 10+ devs.

**Wrong database -** 

E-commerce used MongoDB for orders/inventory.

Result: Complex joins in code = 2-second page loads. Lost customers.

Fix: PostgreSQL for relational data. Mongo for unstructured.

**No caching -** 

SaaS hit database on every request.

Result: 800ms response times, $8K/month AWS with 500 users.

Fix: Redis for sessions/queries. CDN for assets.

These days I use socratesai.dev to think through architecture decisions before committing and claude for coding in general.

Need to find enterprise platform for Real time speech-to-text with diarization - bad experience so far,Loner_Cat,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nx08g9/need_to_find_enterprise_platform_for_real_time/,"For an app I'm developing I need to implement real time speech recognition with diarization; since this is not my area of expertise, my idea was to go for enterprise platforms like Speechmatics, Google Cloud and Deepgram - three services that looking on various subreddits come up often as the best.

  
Well the performance I encountered with these three is pretty terrible. In particular diarization fails utterly: it often attributes part of speeches to the wrong speaker, and sometimes completely switches the roles (i.e. speaker 1 becomes speaker 2 and vice versa, even after minutes of talking), making the application unusable. Speech to text itself contains large amount of errors.

The context is not even that difficult; it's just dialogues between two people, generally in quiet rooms. I can afford to allow for a bit of latency, about 1.5/2 seconds and give up on partial results. Only real source of difficulty is the language, as I have to support non-english languages as italian and french (but separately one from the other).

So, what I wonder is: are there better services? Or is this the industry standard?"

Looking for a Software,lizzythemermaidsloth,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nwebr9/looking_for_a_software/,"Hi! 

Any advice or help would be appreciated. 

I work for an adult day program company and we are looking for a program that can help simplify our scheduling of our spaces. We have lots of rooms that we can send groups of our participants and staff to, but each room can hold a different amount of groups. We also can send groups on outings, but we could label those as a room, since we can only send a set amount of participants on each outing. We only need the service to assist us with booking the rooms because we can distribute them to our staff. We just need to be able to see all of our room and booking options and be able to plug in groups in the available spots. 

We looked into MindBody, but on our call with them they believed we would be paying too much for services they have that we will not use. I found one called Kadence that I will be calling tomorrow to book a possible demo, but we are unsure. 

If you know anything about a software that would be able to assist with this that would be appreciated, thank you so much! "
live polling software that narrows down,fanaticalferret,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nw9pmi/live_polling_software_that_narrows_down/,"for context, I am hosting a panel at a convention which is a sing along and I thought it would be fun for the crowd to vote on which song to do next. 
is there any (ideally free) polling website or app that people could go to a simple link/QR code and vote without logging in or paying anything or having to download an app. the vote would start with a list of songs and they can vote on which song should go next. ideally i’d like the results to update live on the big screen so people can see as they vote which songs are winning. then when a song wins, it should show the result, then i could start the poll over with the previous winning song no longer an option? 

if the narrowing down thing isn’t out there, i could also just keep track of what songs we have already done/hope that people don’t keep voting for the same songs lol, and in that case, maybe just google forms would work? 
thanks!"
VHS conversion software,cemetery_travel916,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nwir70/vhs_conversion_software/,"I’m really into converting VHS to digital for roughly 7 years now. The main program I use is called “Corel Easy VHS”. The program only converts in MPEG-4 which seems to be pretty much none existing nowadays. I’d use an old version of FreeMake to convert the MPEG to Mp4 on my old laptop that still uses Windows 7. This week FreeMake has been glitching when I try to start it up. I did a bit of research here on Reddit and found that VLC can convert the MPEG’s to Mp4. I’m still learning the ropes to the program. My problem is that when I converted my digital VHS MPEG files to Mp4, they would come out distorted and have different shades of green.

 

What am I doing wrong with VLC? Is there an alternative to converting MPEG to Mp4 using a different program or online program? Is it possible just to convert VHS to Mp4 and if so how do I do that? Thank You! "

Need recommendation: Project Database Software for Business Development,ClutchController,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nwc4gw/need_recommendation_project_database_software_for/,"Hi everyone, I could use a recommendation for software. I work at a VERY small consulting company (about 20 people total). Because we're so small, we don't have a dedicated business development or proposal development team, so we all contribute to writing proposals to win contracts. Where we all get stuck is finding work samples/case studies that align with what the contract is asking for. Even though we're a small company, a lot of us are really isolated in our areas of work, so we don't know who is doing what...and also most of us have no idea what projects have been historically done. I want to make a recommendation to my company to get a software to help us out here. Ideally it would:

1. Contain project name, description, timeline, and contact info for a reference
2. Even better if we can tailor more than one description field to highlight the work from certain angles (e.g., we have projects where we do compliance and community outreach, so being able to label those narratives separately would be a big help)
3. **Most importantly:** Tags/filters for project types. Again, a lot of projects have multiple elements like Facilitation, Community Engagement, Training, Compliance, etc., so being able to filter by those areas of work would be the biggest help for when we're writing a proposal that wants us to highlight specific experience.

Thanks in advance!"

Built an open source Google Maps Street View Panorama Scraper.,yousephx,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nvq5x1/built_an_open_source_google_maps_street_view/,"With [gsvp-dl](https://github.com/yousephzidan/gsvp-dl), an open source solution written in Python, you are able to download millions of panorama images off Google Maps Street View.

Unlike other existing solutions (which fail to address major edge cases), [gsvp-dl](https://github.com/yousephzidan/gsvp-dl) downloads panoramas in their correct form and size with unmatched accuracy. Using Python Asyncio and Aiohttp, it can handle bulk downloads, scaling to millions of panoramas per day.

It was a fun project to work on, as there was no documentation whatsoever, whether by Google or other existing solutions. So, I documented the key points that explain why a panorama image looks the way it does based on the given inputs (mainly zoom levels).

Other solutions don’t match up because they ignore edge cases, especially pre-2016 images with different resolutions. They used fixed width and height that only worked for post-2016 panoramas, which caused black spaces in older ones.

The way I was able to reverse engineer Google Maps Street View API was by sitting all day for a week, doing nothing but observing the results of the endpoint, testing inputs, assembling panoramas, observing outputs, and repeating. With no documentation, no lead, and no reference, it was all trial and error.

I believe I have covered most edge cases, though I still doubt I may have missed some. Despite testing hundreds of panoramas at different inputs, I’m sure there could be a case I didn’t encounter. So feel free to fork the repo and make a pull request if you come across one, or find a bug/unexpected behavior.

Thanks for checking it out!

Software to help me copy/paste and type stuff from different windows?,Gileotine,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nvgszq/software_to_help_me_copypaste_and_type_stuff_from/,"Hi everyone I'm greyson,  
tl;dr software that can help me automate copying something from X,Y,Z box and paste it into another window in a certain format like 'X/Y/Z'

I work as a data processor/data entry person at my job and everything I do is copy and paste, basically. Copy details from one window into another in a certain format. Since the things I am copying are a known/empirical quantity (they're from our systems), I figured I could use a program that can recognize what's in 'X' box and copy it over to 'X2' in the format I want.

A coworker suggested TypeItIn, but I am hesitant because it looks very barebones and googling it presents no results, only a few poorly made youtube videos. I dunno how I'll self-learn like that. I'm asking for suggestions for the purposes I've described above.

I built a free open-source graph-making tool,MattTorrLunn,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nvek23/i_built_a_free_opensource_graphmaking_tool/,"

Hi everyone,

I’ve been working on a project called **Evograph**, a fullstack graph creation tool that’s free and open source. The goal is to make it easy to create and customize graphs for everyday use, school projects, or workplace reports — without expensive software or a steep learning curve.

**What it does:**

* Create clean, customizable graphs quickly
* Simple UI (no overcomplicated menus)
* 100% free and open source

**Why I made it:**I wanted something lightweight, accessible, and free that still produces professional-looking graphs. Most tools I found were either too limited or locked behind subscriptions, so I decided to build my own.

**Try it out here:**

* Live demo: [https://evograph.vercel.app/](https://evograph.vercel.app/)
* GitHub repo: [https://github.com/MattTorrSuarr/Evograph](https://github.com/MattTorrSuarr/Evograph)

I’d love for you to try it out and let me know:

* What works well?
* What’s confusing or missing?"

Video Editor to Make Frame Perfect Cuts in 4K .mkv Files?,Unsungghost,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1nuxt9x/video_editor_to_make_frame_perfect_cuts_in_4k_mkv/,"I rip a lot of the Blurays that I have and I really don't like when streaming companies put their logos at the beginning and end of video files. Also sometimes they'll put a brand new, color, CGI intro for a black and white movie. I'd like to trim some of these logos, and I've been having trouble doing it in 4K files.

I've been using VideoReDo for editing 1080p and 480p files. But it's pretty much a dead project and it doesn't work on 4K files at all. I've read a few other threads on the subject, but they're at least 3 years old, so hopefully something has come around in that time.

So what are people using? I've tried a few but they all have limitations. I would really like these criteria, if possible.

1. Works with 4K files

2. Frame perfect cuts, not at keyframes. This is going to be the first thing appearing, I don't want it looking bugged or have audio clipped

3. It would be nice if it didn't have to re-encode the entire file, just the parts around the cuts. VideoReDo does this and it makes it so much faster and preserves more quality

4. Preserves and trims the subtitles as well. VideoReDo can't do this."
